<li>

To compute the homology groups of all the subcomplexes $A \subset X$ and the corresponding quotient complexes $X / A$, we first identify the subcomplexes of $X$. The complex $X$ consists of a 0-cell (point), a 1-cell (circle), and two 2-cells attached to the 1-cell via maps of degrees 2 and 3.

All subcomplexes $A$ of $X$ are:
1. The trivial subcomplex (0-cell only).
2. The 1-cell (the circle).
3. One of the 2-cells.
4. Both 2-cells (the entire complex $X$).

Now, we compute the homology groups for each subcomplex $A$ and the corresponding quotient complexes $X / A$:
1. For the trivial subcomplex:

   $H_0(A) \cong \mathbb{Z}$, $H_n(A) = 0$ for $n > 0$.
2. For the 1-cell:

   $H_0(A) \cong \mathbb{Z}$, $H_1(A) \cong \mathbb{Z}$, $H_n(A) = 0$ for $n > 1$.
3. For one of the 2-cells:

   Since a 2-cell is contractible, we have $H_0(A) \cong \mathbb{Z}$, $H_n(A) = 0$ for $n > 0$.
4. For both 2-cells (the entire complex $X$): Mayer-Vietoris sequence reads
    
    $\dots \rightarrow H_2(S^1) \rightarrow H_2(e^2_1) \oplus H_2(e^2_2) \rightarrow H_2(X) \rightarrow H_1(S^1) \rightarrow H_1(e^2_1) \oplus H_1(e^2_2) \rightarrow H_1(X) \rightarrow H_0(S^1) \rightarrow H_0(e^2_1) \oplus H_0(e^2_2) \rightarrow H_0(X) \rightarrow 0$
   
    After plugin in the known homology groups, we find:

    $\dots \rightarrow 0 \rightarrow 0 \rightarrow H_2(X) \rightarrow \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow 0 \rightarrow H_1(X) \rightarrow \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow H_0(X) \rightarrow 0$

    From this, we deduce that $H_2(X) \cong \mathbb{Z}$, $H_1(X) \cong 0$, and $H_0(X) \cong \mathbb{Z}$.

Let $\Delta^n=\left[v_0, \cdots, v_n\right]$ have its natural $\Delta$-complex structure with $k$-simplices $\left[v_{i_0}, \cdots, v_{i_k}\right]$ for $i_0<\cdots<i_k$.

Compute the ranks of the simplicial (or cellular) chain groups $\Delta_i\left(\Delta^n\right)$ and the subgroups of cycles and boundaries. [Hint: Pascal's triangle.]

Apply this to show that the $k$-skeleton of $\Delta^n$ has homology groups $\tilde{H}_i\left(\left(\Delta^n\right)^k\right)$ equal to 0 for $i<k$, and free of rank $\binom{n}{k+1}$ for $i=k$.

Solution:

The $n$-simplex $\Delta^n$ has $\binom{n+1}{k+1}$ $k$-simplices, corresponding to the choice of $k+1$ vertices from the $n+1$ vertices of the simplex. Therefore, the rank of the simplicial chain group $\Delta_k(\Delta^n)$ is $\binom{n+1}{k+1}$.

For the $k$-skeleton of $\Delta^n$, denoted $(\Delta^n)^k$, the homology groups $\tilde{H}_i((\Delta^n)^k)$ can be computed as follows:

- For $i < k$, the $k$-skeleton does not contain any $i$-simplices, so $\tilde{H}_i((\Delta^n)^k) = 0$.

- For $i = k$, the homology group $\tilde{H}_k((\Delta^n)^k)$ is generated by the $k$-simplices, and its rank is given by the number of $k$-simplices in $\Delta^n$, which is $\binom{n+1}{k+1}$.

Show the isomorphism between cellular and singular homology is natural in the following sense:

A map $f: X \rightarrow Y$ that is cellular - satisfying $f(X^n) \subset Y^n$ for all $n$ - induces a chain map $`f_*`$ between the cellular chain complexes of $X$ and $Y$, and the map $`f_*: H_n^{C W}(X) \rightarrow H_n^{C W}(Y)`$ induced by this chain map corresponds to $f_*: H_n(X) \rightarrow H_n(Y)$ under the isomorphism $H_n^{C W} \approx H_n$.

Solution:

$H_n^{CW}(X) \approx H_n(X)$: $H_n(X)$ can be identified with $H_n\left(X^n\right) / \operatorname{Im} \partial_{n+1}$. Since $j_n$ is injective, it maps $\operatorname{Im} \partial_{n+1}$ isomorphically onto $\operatorname{Im}\left(j_n \partial_{n+1}\right)=\operatorname{Im} d_{n+1}$ and $H_n\left(X^n\right)$ isomorphically onto $\operatorname{Im} j_n=\operatorname{Ker} \partial_n$. Since $j_{n-1}$ is injective, $\operatorname{Ker} \partial_n= \operatorname{Ker} d_n$. Thus $j_n$ induces an isomorphism of the quotient $H_n\left(X^n\right) / \operatorname{Im} \partial_{n+1}$ onto $\operatorname{Ker} d_n / \operatorname{Im} d_{n+1}$.

To show naturality,

Show that if the closed orientable surface $M_g$ of genus $g$ is a covering space of $M_h$, then $g=n(h-1)+1$ for some $n$, namely, $n$ is the number of sheets in the covering.

[Conversely, if $g=n(h-1)+1$ then there is an $n$-sheeted covering $M_g \rightarrow M_h$, as we saw in Example 1.41.]

Solution:

The Euler characteristic is the alternate sum of the ranks of the homology groups. For a closed orientable surface $M_g$ of genus $g$, we have:
$H_0(M_g) \cong \mathbb{Z}$,
$H_1(M_g) \cong \mathbb{Z}^{2g}$,
$H_2(M_g) \cong \mathbb{Z}$.


# 29
The surface $M_g$ of genus $g$, embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$ in the standard way, bounds a compact region $R$.

Two copies of $R$, glued together by the identity map between their boundary surfaces $M_g$, form a closed 3-manifold $X$.

Compute the homology groups of $X$ via the Mayer-Vietoris sequence for this decomposition of $X$ into two copies of $R$.

Also compute the relative groups $H_i(R, M_g)$.

Solution:

The Mayer-Vietoris sequence reads

$\cdots \rightarrow H_n(M_g) \rightarrow H_n(R) \oplus H_n(R) \rightarrow H_n(X) \rightarrow H_{n-1}(M_g) \rightarrow \cdots$
