<li>

Show that $H_0(X, A)=0$ iff $A$ meets each path-component of $X$.
</li>
<li>
  
Show that $H_1(X, A)=0$ iff $H_1(A) \rightarrow H_1(X)$ is surjective and each path-component of $X$ contains at most one path-component of $A$.

<ol type="a">
<li>

Compute the homology groups $H_n(X, A)$ when $X$ is $S^2$ or $S^1 \times S^1$ and $A$ is a finite set of points in $X$.
</li>
<li>

Compute the groups $H_n(X, A)$ and $H_n(X, B)$ for $X$ a closed orientable surface of genus two with $A$ and $B$ the circles shown. [What are $X / A$ and $X / B$ ?]

Show that the second barycentric subdivision of a $\Delta$-complex is a simplicial complex.

Namely, show that the first barycentric subdivision produces a $\Delta$-complex with the property that each simplex has all its vertices distinct, then show that for a $\Delta$-complex with this property, barycentric subdivision produces a simplicial complex.

# 29
Show that $S^1 \times S^1$ and $S^1 \vee S^1 \vee S^2$ have isomorphic homology groups in all dimensions, but their universal covering spaces do not.
