If $f: G_1 \to G_2$ and $g: H_1 \to H_2$ are homomorphisms of groups, then there is a unique homomorphism $h: G_1 * H_1 \to G_2 * H_2$ such that $h \upharpoonright G_1=f$ and $h \upharpoonright H_1=g$.

Proof

Let $`i_1:G_2\to G_2*H_2,i_2:H_2\to G_2*H_2`$ be the inclusion maps.

By the universal mapping property for free products, $`i_1\circ f:G_1\to G_2*H_2`$, $`i_2\circ g:H_1\to G_2*H_2`$ induce a unique map $`h:G_1*H_1 \to G_2*H_2`$ such that $h \upharpoonright G_1=f$ and $h \upharpoonright H_1=g$.

1. Show that the additive group of rationals $\mathbf{Q}$ is not finitely generated.
2. Show that $\mathbf{Q}$ is not free.
3. Conclude that Exercise 9 is false if the hypothesis "finitely generated" is omitted.

Proof

1. We will show the subgroup $H$ of $\mathbf{Q}$ generated by $\{\frac1{2^n}:n=1,2,\dots\}$ is not finitely generated. Suppose $q_1,\dots,q_n$ generate $H$, we can take a sufficiently large $e\in\mathbf{Z}$ such that $2^eq_1,\dots,2^eq_n$ are all integers. Then $x=2^{-e-1}\in H$ is a $\mathbf{Z}$-linear combination of $q_1,\dots,q_n$, but $2^ex$ is not an integer, a contradiction.
2. $\mathbf{Q}=2\mathbf{Q}$, but in a free abelian group, a basis element cannot be written as $2$ times any element.
3. $\mathbf{Q}$ is an abelian group in which no element (except 0) has finite order. But $\mathbf{Q}$ is not free.

Let $D_k$ be the dihedral group of order $2 k$, where $k \geq 3$.

1. Show that the number of automorphisms of the group $D_k$ is equal to $k \cdot \phi(k)$. Here $\phi$ is Euler's $\phi$-function.
2. Automorphisms of $D_k$ form a group; let us denote it by $\mathrm{Aut}(D_k)$. What is the structure of $\mathrm{Aut}(D_k)$? Describe the group as explicitly as you can.

For a finite group $G$, denote by $s(G)$ the number of its subgroups.
1. Show that $s(G)$ is finite.
2. Show that if $H$ is a nontrivial normal subgroup of $G$, then $s(G / H)<s(G)$.
3. Show that $s(G)=2$ if and only if $G$ is cyclic of prime order.
4. Show that $s(G)=3$ if and only if $G$ is a cyclic group whose order is a square of a prime.
