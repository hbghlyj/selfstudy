## Problem 6
The cyclic group of order 6 is the group defined by generators $a, b$ and relations $a^2=b^3=a^{-1} b^{-1} a b=e$.

Proof

Let $C_6=\langle x|x^6=e\rangle$ be the cyclic group of order 6. Define a map $f\colon C_6\to G$ by $f(x)=ab$ and extend it to a homomorphism. Since $(ab)^6=a^2=b^3=e$, $f$ is well-defined.

Define a map $g\colon G\to C_6$ by $g(a)=x^3,g(b)=x^2$ and extend it to a homomorphism. Since $g(a)^2=g(b)^3=g(a)^{-1}g(b)^{-1}g(a)g(b)=e$, $g$ is well-defined.

To see that $f,g$ are inverses of each other, it suffices to check on generators:
- $g(f(x))=g(ab)=g(a)g(b)=x^3x^2=x$
- $f(g(a))=f(x^3)=(ab)^3=a$, $f(g(b))=f(x^2)=(ab)^2=b$

Thus $G\cong C_6$.

## Problem 10
The operation of free product is commutative and associative: for any groups $A, B, C$, $A * B \cong B * A$ and $A *(B * C) \cong(A * B) * C$.

Proof

1. By the universal mapping property for free products, the inclusion maps $i_A\colon A\to B * A,i_B\colon B\to B * A$ induce a unique map $f\colon A * B\to B * A$. To see that $f$ is an isomorphism, we construct its inverse $g: B * A \to A * B$. By the universal property, the inclusion maps $j_A: A \to A * B$ and $j_B: B \to A * B$ induce a unique homomorphism $g: B * A \to A * B$.
   For any $a \in A$, $(g \circ f)(a) = g(f(a)) = g(a) = a$. For any $b \in B$, $(g \circ f)(b) = g(f(b)) = g(b) = b$. Since $g \circ f$ is the identity on the generators of $A * B$, it is the identity homomorphism. Similarly, $f \circ g$ is the identity on $B * A$. Thus, $f$ is an isomorphism.

2. To prove $A * (B * C) \cong (A * B) * C$, let $\phi_A\colon A \to (A * B) * C$, $\phi_B\colon B \to (A * B) * C$, and $\phi_C\colon C \to (A * B) * C$ be the canonical inclusion maps.

   By the universal property of $B * C$, the maps $\phi_B$ and $\phi_C$ induce a unique homomorphism $\psi\colon B * C \to (A * B) * C$.

   Now, by the universal property of $A * (B * C)$, the maps $\phi_A\colon A \to (A * B) * C$ and $\psi\colon B * C \to (A * B) * C$ induce a unique homomorphism $f\colon A * (B * C) \to (A * B) * C$.

   This homomorphism $f$ sends any element from $A, B,$ or $C$ to itself in $(A * B) * C$.

   Symmetrically, one can construct a homomorphism $g\colon(A * B) * C \to A * (B * C)$ which also acts as the identity on elements from $A, B, C$.

   The compositions $g \circ f$ and $f \circ g$ are the identity on the generators, and are therefore the identity homomorphisms. Thus, $f$ is an isomorphism.

## Problem 11
If $N$ is the normal subgroup of $A * B$ generated by $A$, then $(A * B) / N \cong B$.

Proof

## Problem 12
If $G$ and $H$ each have more than one element, then $G * H$ is an infinite group with center $\langle e\rangle$.

Proof

## Problem 15
If $f: G_1 \to G_2$ and $g: H_1 \to H_2$ are homomorphisms of groups, then there is a unique homomorphism $h: G_1 * H_1 \to G_2 * H_2$ such that $h \upharpoonright G_1=f$ and $h \upharpoonright H_1=g$.

Proof

Let $`i_1:G_2\to G_2*H_2,i_2:H_2\to G_2*H_2`$ be the inclusion maps.

By the universal mapping property for free products, $`i_1\circ f:G_1\to G_2*H_2`$, $`i_2\circ g:H_1\to G_2*H_2`$ induce a unique map $`h:G_1*H_1 \to G_2*H_2`$ such that $h \upharpoonright G_1=f$ and $h \upharpoonright H_1=g$.

## Problem 10
1. Show that the additive group of rationals $\mathbf{Q}$ is not finitely generated.
2. Show that $\mathbf{Q}$ is not free.
3. Conclude that Exercise 9 is false if the hypothesis "finitely generated" is omitted.

Proof

1. We will show the subgroup $H$ of $\mathbf{Q}$ generated by $\{\frac1{2^n}:n=1,2,\dots\}$ is not finitely generated. Suppose $q_1,\dots,q_n$ generate $H$, we can take a sufficiently large $e\in\mathbf{Z}$ such that $2^eq_1,\dots,2^eq_n$ are all integers. Then $x=2^{-e-1}\in H$ is a $\mathbf{Z}$-linear combination of $q_1,\dots,q_n$, but $2^ex$ is not an integer, a contradiction. $H$ is a subgroup of $\mathbf{Q}$ that is not finitely generated, it follows that $\mathbf{Q}$ cannot be finitely generated.
2. A non-trivial free abelian group $F$ is not divisible. For example, if $F$ has a basis element $e$, then there is no element $y \in F$ such that $2y = e$, because the coefficient of $e$ in the basis expansion of $y$ would have to be $1/2$, which is not an integer. However, $\mathbf{Q}$ is a divisible group, where for any $x \in \mathbf{Q}$, there is a $y \in \mathbf{Q}$ (namely $y=x/2$) such that $2y=x$.
3. $\mathbf{Q}$ is an abelian group in which no element (except 0) has finite order. But $\mathbf{Q}$ is not free.
