## Problem 6
The cyclic group of order 6 is the group defined by generators $a, b$ and relations $a^2=b^3=a^{-1} b^{-1} a b=e$.

Proof

Let $C_6=\langle x|x^6=e\rangle$ be the cyclic group of order 6. Define a map $f\colon C_6\to G$ by $f(x)=ab^{-1}$ and extend it to a homomorphism. Since $f(x)^6=(ab^{-1})^6=e$, $f$ is well-defined.

Define a map $g\colon G\to C_6$ by $g(a)=x^3,g(b)=x^2$ and extend it to a homomorphism. Since $g(a)^2=g(b)^3=g(a)^{-1}g(b)^{-1}g(a)g(b)=e$, $g$ is well-defined.

To see that $f,g$ are inverses of each other, it suffices to check on generators:
- $g(f(x))=g(ab^{-1})=g(a)g(b)^{-1}=x^3x^{-2}=x$
- $f(g(a))=f(x^3)=(ab^{-1})^3=a$, $f(g(b))=f(x^2)=(ab^{-1})^2=b$

Thus $G\cong C_6$.

## Problem 10
The operation of free product is commutative and associative: for any groups $A, B, C$, $A * B \cong B * A$ and $A *(B * C) \cong(A * B) * C$.

Proof

1. By the universal mapping property for free products, the inclusion maps $i_A\colon A\to B * A,i_B\colon B\to B * A$ induce a unique map $f\colon A * B\to B * A$. To see that $f$ is an isomorphism, we construct its inverse $g: B * A \to A * B$. By the universal property, the inclusion maps $j_A: A \to A * B$ and $j_B: B \to A * B$ induce a unique homomorphism $g: B * A \to A * B$.

   For any $a \in A$, $(g \circ f)(a) = g(f(a)) = g(a) = a$. For any $b \in B$, $(g \circ f)(b) = g(f(b)) = g(b) = b$. Since $g \circ f$ is the identity on the generators of $A * B$, it is the identity homomorphism. Similarly, $f \circ g$ is the identity on $B * A$. Thus, $f$ is an isomorphism.

2. To prove $A * (B * C) \cong (A * B) * C$, let $\phi_A\colon A \to (A * B) * C$, $\phi_B\colon B \to (A * B) * C$, and $\phi_C\colon C \to (A * B) * C$ be the canonical inclusion maps.

   By the universal property of $B * C$, the maps $\phi_B$ and $\phi_C$ induce a unique homomorphism $\psi\colon B * C \to (A * B) * C$.

   Now, by the universal property of $A * (B * C)$, the maps $\phi_A\colon A \to (A * B) * C$ and $\psi\colon B * C \to (A * B) * C$ induce a unique homomorphism $f\colon A * (B * C) \to (A * B) * C$.

   This homomorphism $f$ sends any element from $A, B,$ or $C$ to itself in $(A * B) * C$.

   Symmetrically, one can construct a homomorphism $g\colon(A * B) * C \to A * (B * C)$ which also acts as the identity on elements from $A, B, C$.

   The compositions $g \circ f$ and $f \circ g$ are the identity on the generators, and are therefore the identity homomorphisms. Thus, $f$ is an isomorphism.

## Problem 11
If $N$ is the normal subgroup of $A * B$ generated by $A$, then $(A * B) / N \cong B$.

Proof

Let $G = A * B$. By the universal property of free products, there exists a natural surjective homomorphism $\phi: G \to B$ defined by $\phi(a) = e_B$ for all $a \in A$ and $\phi(b) = b$ for all $b \in B$, where $e_B$ is the identity element of $B$. The kernel of $\phi$ contains $A$ by construction, and since it is a normal subgroup, it must contain $N$. The induced map $(A*B)/N \to B$ is an isomorphism, so the kernel is exactly $N$. By the first isomorphism theorem, we have $(A * B) / N \cong B$.

## Problem 12
If $G$ and $H$ each have more than one element, then $G * H$ is an infinite group with center $\langle e\rangle$.

Proof

Let $g,h$ be non-identity elements of $G,H$ respectively. Then $(gh)^n$ are all reduced words for $n=1,2,\dots$, so the subgroup generated by $gh$ is infinite. Thus $G * H$ is infinite.

Let $z$ be a non-identity element in the center of $G * H$. If $z \in G$, then for any non-identity $h \in H$, $zh=hz$. But $zh$ and $hz$ are distinct reduced words, a contradiction. Similarly, $z \notin H$. Thus, the reduced word for $z$ must have length at least 2. Without loss of generality, we can assume that the reduced word $z$ starts with a letter from $G$. Then for a non-identity $h \in H$, the reduced word for $zh$ starts with a letter from $G$, while the reduced word for $hz$ starts with a letter from $H$. Thus $zh\neq hz$, a contradiction. Therefore, the center of $G * H$ is trivial.

## Problem 15
If $f: G_1 \to G_2$ and $g: H_1 \to H_2$ are homomorphisms of groups, then there is a unique homomorphism $h: G_1 * H_1 \to G_2 * H_2$ such that $h \upharpoonright G_1=f$ and $h \upharpoonright H_1=g$.

Proof

Let $`i_1:G_2\to G_2*H_2,i_2:H_2\to G_2*H_2`$ be the inclusion maps.

By the universal mapping property for free products, $`i_1\circ f:G_1\to G_2*H_2`$, $`i_2\circ g:H_1\to G_2*H_2`$ induce a unique map $`h:G_1*H_1 \to G_2*H_2`$ such that $h \upharpoonright G_1=f$ and $h \upharpoonright H_1=g$.

## Problem 10
1. Show that the additive group of rationals $\mathbf{Q}$ is not finitely generated.
2. Show that $\mathbf{Q}$ is not free.
3. Conclude that Exercise 9 is false if the hypothesis "finitely generated" is omitted.

Proof

1. We will show the subgroup $H$ of $\mathbf{Q}$ generated by $`\{\frac1{2^n}:n=1,2,\dots\}`$ is not finitely generated. Suppose $q_1,\dots,q_n$ generate $H$, we can take a sufficiently large $e\in\mathbf{Z}$ such that $2^eq_1,\dots,2^eq_n$ are all integers. Then $x=2^{-e-1}\in H$ is a $\mathbf{Z}$-linear combination of $q_1,\dots,q_n$, but $2^ex$ is not an integer, a contradiction. $H$ is a subgroup of $\mathbf{Q}$ that is not finitely generated, it follows that $\mathbf{Q}$ cannot be finitely generated.
2. A non-trivial free abelian group $F$ is not divisible. For example, if $F$ has a basis element $e$, then there is no element $y \in F$ such that $2y = e$, because the coefficient of $e$ in the basis expansion of $y$ would have to be $1/2$, which is not an integer. However, $\mathbf{Q}$ is a divisible group, where for any $x \in \mathbf{Q}$, there is a $y \in \mathbf{Q}$ (namely $y=x/2$) such that $2y=x$.
3. $\mathbf{Q}$ is an abelian group in which no element (except 0) has finite order. But $\mathbf{Q}$ is not free.

Let $D_k$ be the dihedral group of order $2 k$, where $k \geq 3$.

1. Show that the number of automorphisms of the group $D_k$ is equal to $k \cdot \phi(k)$. Here $\phi$ is Euler's $\phi$-function.
2. Automorphisms of $D_k$ form a group; let us denote it by $\mathrm{Aut}(D_k)$. What is the structure of $\mathrm{Aut}(D_k)$? Describe the group as explicitly as you can.

Proof

1. An automorphism $\varphi$ of $D_k$ is determined by the images of its generators, $\varphi(r)$ and $\varphi(s)$, which must preserve the group relations. Since $\varphi$ preserves orders, $\varphi(r)$ must have order $k$ and $\varphi(s)$ must have order 2.
   - The elements of order $k$ in $D_k$ are $r^m$ with $\gcd(m, k) = 1$. There are $\phi(k)$ such choices for $\varphi(r)$.
   - The elements of order 2 are the $k$ reflections $r^n s$ ($n=0, \dots, k-1$) and, if $k$ is even, the rotation $r^{k/2}$.
   - We must check which choices for $\varphi(s)$ preserve the relation $\varphi(s)\varphi(r)\varphi(s) = \varphi(r)^{-1}$, given $\varphi(r) = r^m$.
     - If $\varphi(s) = r^n s$: The relation holds, as $(r^n s)r^m(r^n s) = r^{n-m}(sr^ns) = r^{n-m}r^{-n} = r^{-m} = \varphi(r)^{-1}$.
     - If $k$ is even and $\varphi(s) = r^{k/2}$: The relation becomes $r^m = r^{-m}$, which implies $k|2m$. For $k \ge 3$ and $\gcd(m,k)=1$, this is impossible.
   - Thus, there are $\phi(k)$ choices for $\varphi(r)$ and $k$ choices for $\varphi(s)$. Each of these $k \cdot \phi(k)$ pairs defines a distinct automorphism.

2. To determine the structure of $\mathrm{Aut}(D_k)$, we note that each automorphism is determined by the images of $r$ and $s$. We can represent an automorphism $\varphi$ by a pair $(m, n)$ where $\varphi(r) = r^m$ with $\gcd(m, k) = 1$ and $\varphi(s) = r^n s$ for some $`n \in \{0, 1, \ldots, k-1\}`$. The composition of two automorphisms $(m_1, n_1)$ and $(m_2, n_2)$ is given by:

   $r \mapsto \varphi_1(\varphi_2(r)) = \varphi_1(r^{m_2}) = (r^{m_1})^{m_2} = r^{m_1 m_2}$
   
   $s \mapsto \varphi_1(\varphi_2(s)) = \varphi_1(r^{n_2}s) = (r^{m_1})^{n_2}(r^{n_1}s) = r^{n_1 + m_1 n_2}s$

   Thus, the group operation in $\mathrm{Aut}(D_k)$ can be described as:
   
   $(m_1, n_1) * (m_2, n_2) = (m_1 m_2 \mod k, n_1 + m_1 n_2 \mod k)$

For a finite group $G$, denote by $s(G)$ the number of its subgroups.
1. Show that $s(G)$ is finite.
2. Show that if $H$ is a nontrivial normal subgroup of $G$, then $s(G / H)<s(G)$.
3. Show that $s(G)=2$ if and only if $G$ is cyclic of prime order.
4. Show that $s(G)=3$ if and only if $G$ is a cyclic group whose order is a square of a prime.

Proof

1. Since $G$ is finite, it has finitely many subsets. Each subgroup of $G$ is a subset of $G$, so $G$ has finitely many subgroups.
2. Let $\pi: G \to G/H$ be the canonical projection. By the correspondence theorem, there is an injective map from the set of subgroups of $G/H$ to the set of subgroups of $G$, given by $K \mapsto \pi^{-1}(K)$. The image of this map is the set of all subgroups of $G$ that contain $H$. Since $H$ is a nontrivial subgroup, the trivial subgroup $`\{e\}`$ of $G$ does not contain $H$. Thus, $`\{e\}`$ is not in the image of the map, which proves that the map is not surjective. Therefore, $s(G/H) < s(G)$.
3. If $G$ is cyclic of prime order $p$, then its only subgroups are $`\{e\}`$ and $G$ itself, so $s(G) = 2$. Conversely, if $s(G) = 2$, then $G$ has no nontrivial proper subgroups. Any nontrivial element must generate $G$, so $G$ is cyclic of prime order (if its order $|G|$ were composite, say $|G|=mn$ with $1<m,n<|G|$, then as a cyclic group, it would have a subgroup of order $m$, which is a nontrivial proper subgroup, a contradiction).
4. If $G$ is cyclic of order $p^2$ for some prime $p$, then by Lagrange's theorem its subgroups can only have orders $1, p, p^2$. For a cyclic group, there is exactly one subgroup for each divisor of its order. Thus its subgroups are $`\{e\}`$, the unique subgroup of order $p$, and $G$ itself, so $s(G) = 3$. Conversely, if $s(G) = 3$, $G$ has exactly one nontrivial proper subgroup. Any element not in this subgroup must generate $G$, so $G$ is cyclic. The number of subgroups of a cyclic group of order $n$ is the number of divisors of $n$, $\tau(n)$. We have $\tau(|G|) = 3$, which implies $|G| = p^2$ for some prime $p$. Thus, $G$ is a cyclic group of order $p^2$.
