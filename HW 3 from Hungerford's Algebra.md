## Problem 6
The cyclic group of order 6 is the group defined by generators  and relations $a^2=b^3=a^{-1} b^{-1} a b=e$.

Proof

Let    be the cyclic group of order 6. Define a map   by   and extend it to a homomorphism. Since $(ab)^6=a^2=b^3=ef$ is well-defined.

Define a map   by $g(a)=x^3,g(b)=x^2g(a)^2=g(b)^3=g(a)^{-1}g(b)^{-1}g(a)g(b)=eg$ is well-defined.

To see that  are inverses of each other, it suffices to check on generators:
- $g(f(x))=g(ab)=g(a)g(b)=x^3x^2=x$
- $f(g(a))=f(x^3)=(ab)^3=af(g(b))=f(x^2)=(ab)^2=b$

Thus  .

## Problem 10
The operation of free product is commutative and associative: for any groups ,     and      .

Proof

1. By the universal mapping property for free products, the inclusion maps      induce a unique map    . To see that  is an isomorphism, we construct its inverse     . By the universal property, the inclusion maps     and     induce a unique homomorphism     .
   For any  ,     . For any  ,     . Since   is the identity on the generators of  , it is the identity homomorphism. Similarly,   is the identity on  . Thus,  is an isomorphism.

2. To prove      , let    ,    , and     be the canonical inclusion maps.

   By the universal property of  , the maps  and  induce a unique homomorphism     .

   Now, by the universal property of   , the maps     and      induce a unique homomorphism      .

   This homomorphism  sends any element from  or  to itself in   .

   Symmetrically, one can construct a homomorphism       which also acts as the identity on elements from .

   The compositions   and   are the identity on the generators, and are therefore the identity homomorphisms. Thus,  is an isomorphism.

## Problem 12
If  and  each have more than one element, then   is an infinite group with center .

Proof

Let  be non-identity elements of  respectively. Then  are all reduced words for  , so the subgroup generated by  is infinite. Thus   is infinite.

Let  be a non-identity element in the center of  . If  , then for any non-identity  ,  . But  and  are distinct reduced words, a contradiction. Similarly,  . Thus, the reduced word for  must have length at least 2. Without loss of generality, we can assume that the reduced word  starts with a letter from . Then for a non-identity  , the reduced word for  starts with a letter from , while the reduced word for  starts with a letter from . Thus  , a contradiction. Therefore, the center of   is trivial.

# Section II.1
## Problem 10
1. Show that the additive group of rationals  is not finitely generated.
2. Show that  is not free.
3. Conclude that Exercise 9 is false if the hypothesis "finitely generated" is omitted.

Proof

1. We will show the subgroup  of  generated by    is not finitely generated. Suppose  generate , we can take a sufficiently large   such that  are all integers. Then    is a -linear combination of , but  is not an integer, a contradiction.  is a subgroup of  that is not finitely generated, it follows that  cannot be finitely generated.
2. A non-trivial free abelian group $F$ is not divisible. For example, if $F$ has a basis element $e$, then there is no element $y \in F$ such that $2y = e$, because the coefficient of $e$ in the basis expansion of $y$ would have to be $1/2$, which is not an integer. However, $\mathbf{Q}$ is a divisible group, where for any $x \in \mathbf{Q}$, there is a $y \in \mathbf{Q}$ (namely $y=x/2$) such that $2y=x$.
3. $\mathbf{Q}$ is an abelian group in which no element (except 0) has finite order. But $\mathbf{Q}$ is not free.

2. Automorphisms of $D_k$ form a group; let us denote it by $\mathrm{Aut}(D_k)$. What is the structure of $\mathrm{Aut}(D_k)$? Describe the group as explicitly as you can.

For a finite group $G$, denote by $s(G)$ the number of its subgroups.
1. Show that $s(G)$ is finite.
2. Show that if $H$ is a nontrivial normal subgroup of $G$, then $s(G / H)<s(G)$.
3. Show that $s(G)=2$ if and only if $G$ is cyclic of prime order.
4. Show that $s(G)=3$ if and only if $G$ is a cyclic group whose order is a square of a prime.

Proof

1. Since $G$ is finite, it has finitely many subsets. Each subgroup of $G$ is a subset of $G$, so $G$ has finitely many subgroups.
2. Let $\pi: G \to G/H$ be the canonical projection. By the correspondence theorem, there is an injective map from the set of subgroups of $G/H$ to the set of subgroups of $G$, given by $K \mapsto \pi^{-1}(K)$. The image of this map is the set of all subgroups of $G$ that contain $H$. Since $H$ is a nontrivial subgroup, the trivial subgroup $`\{e\}`$ of $G$ does not contain $H$. Thus, $`\{e\}`$ is not in the image of the map, which proves that the map is not surjective. Therefore, $s(G/H) < s(G)$.
3. If $G$ is cyclic of prime order $p$, then its only subgroups are $`\{e\}`$ and $G$ itself, so $s(G) = 2$.

    Conversely, if $s(G) = 2$, then $G$ has no nontrivial proper subgroups. Let $g \in G$ be any non-identity element. The subgroup generated by $g$, $\langle g \rangle$, is a nontrivial subgroup of $G$, so it must be equal to $G$. Thus, $G$ is cyclic. If the order of $G$ were not prime, say $|G| = mn$ with $1 < m, n < |G|$, then the subgroup generated by $g^n$ would be a nontrivial proper subgroup of $G$, contradicting the assumption that $s(G) = 2$. Thus, $|G|$ is prime.
4. If $G$ is cyclic of order $p^2$ for some prime $p$, then by Lagrange's theorem its subgroups can only have orders $1, p, p^2$. For a cyclic group, there is exactly one subgroup for each divisor of its order. Thus its subgroups are $`\{e\}`$, the unique subgroup of order $p$, and $G$ itself, so $s(G) = 3$.

    Conversely, if $s(G) = 3$, $G$ has exactly one nontrivial proper subgroup, say $H$. Since $H$ is the only subgroup of its order, by I.5.7 it must be normal in $G$. By part 2, $s(G/H) < s(G)$, so $s(G/H) = 2$. By part 3, $G/H$ is cyclic of prime order, say $p$. Thus, $|G/H| = p$.
    Let $g \in G\setminus H$. Then $g$ has order $|G|$ or $|H|$. If $g$ had order $|H|$, then $\langle g \rangle = H$, so $g \in H$, a contradiction. Thus, $g$ has order $|G|$, so $G$ is cyclic. Since $G$ is cyclic, all its subgroups are cyclic, so $H$ is cyclic.
    Any subgroup of $H$ is also a subgroup of $G$, so $s(H) < s(G)$, so $s(H) = 2$. By part 3, $H$ is cyclic of prime order, say $q$. Thus, $|H| = q$. Therefore, $|G| = |H| \cdot |G/H| = pq$.
