Let $G$ be a finite group. Prove the following 'inverse Schur Lemma': if every $G$-equivariant map $\phi: V \rightarrow V$ is scalar, then $V$ is irreducible. You may need to make additional assumptions on the field for the statement to hold, make sure to clearly state this!
# 2
Suppose $V$ is a completely reducible representation of a group $G$. Show that for every subrepresentation $W \subset V$, the quotient $V / W$ is completely reducible. (Obviously, we are assuming that Maschke's Theorem does not apply, otherwise the question is trivial.)
# 3
Let $V$ be an irreducible finite-dimensional representation of a group $G$. Show that its dual $V^*$ is irreducible as well.
# 4
Suppose that a group $G$ is a product $G=G_1 \times G_2$. Let $V$ be an irreducible representation of $G$ over $\mathbb{C}$. Denote by $\operatorname{res}_{G_1}^G V$ its restriction to $G_1$ : it is given by the composition

$G_1 \rightarrow G \rightarrow \operatorname{GL}(V) .$

Show that $\operatorname{res}_{G_1}^G V \simeq\left(V_1\right)^k$ for some irreducible representation $V_1$ of $G_1$ and $k \geq 1$. (In fact, a stronger statement holds: $V \simeq V_1 \otimes V_2$, where $V_1$ is a representation of $G_1$ and $V_2$ is a representation of $G_2$, but you don't need to prove this.)

# 5
Fix $n$, and denote by $X_k$ the set of all $k$-element subsets of $`\{1, \dots, n\}`$ ($k \leq n$). It carries an action of $S_n$, and we can consider the corresponding representation $V_k$ of $S_n$, where $V_k$ is the space of $\mathbb{C}$-valued functions on $X_k$.

Show that $V_k \simeq V_{n-k}$.

# 6. (Continuation of the previous problem)
Show that $S_n$ has irreducible representations $W_0, W_1, W_2, \ldots, W_{\left\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\right\rfloor}$ such that

$V_k \simeq \bigoplus_{i=0}^k W_i$

for all $k \leq \frac{n}{2}$.
