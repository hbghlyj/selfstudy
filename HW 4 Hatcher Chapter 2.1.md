What familiar space is the quotient $\Delta$-complex of a 2-simplex $[v_0, v_1, v_2]$ obtained by identifying the edges $[v_0, v_1]$ and $[v_1, v_2]$, preserving the ordering of vertices?

Proof

The quotient $\Delta$-complex is homeomorphic to a Möbius strip. By identifying the edges $[v_0, v_1]$ and $[v_1, v_2]$ while preserving the vertex ordering, we create a twist in the surface, resulting in a non-orientable surface with a single boundary component, which is characteristic of a Möbius strip.

Construct a $\Delta$-complex structure on $\mathbb{RP}^n$ as a quotient of a $\Delta$-complex structure on $S^n$ having vertices the two vectors of length 1 along each coordinate axis in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$.

Proof

To construct a $\Delta$-complex structure on $\mathbb{RP}^n$, we start with a convenient $\Delta$-complex structure on $S^n$. We view $S^n$ as being homeomorphic to the boundary of the $(n+1)$-dimensional cross-polytope, which is the set of points in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ satisfying the equation $|x_0| + |x_1| + \cdots + |x_n| = 1$.

This representation decomposes $S^n$ into $2^{n+1}$ n-simplices, each corresponding to a unique combination of signs for the coordinates $(x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_n)$. The set of vertices for this entire $\Delta$-complex consists of the unit vectors along each coordinate axis, both positive and negative.

To obtain a $\Delta$-complex structure on $\mathbb{RP}^n$, we identify antipodal points on $S^n$. This identification pairs each simplex with its antipodal counterpart, effectively halving the number of simplices in the quotient space. The resulting $\Delta$-complex structure on $\mathbb{RP}^n$ consists of $2^n$ n-simplices, with vertices corresponding to the lines through the origin in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ defined by the unit vectors along each coordinate axis.

Compute the simplicial homology groups of the triangular parachute obtained from $\Delta^2$ by identifying its three vertices to a single point.

Proof

Let $a_i, b_i, c_i$ be the edges $[v_0, v_1], [v_1, v_2], [v_0, v_2]$ respectively of each $\Delta_i^2$. Then $a_0 = b_0 = c_0$, $a_i = b_i$, and $c_i = a_{i-1}$ for all $i$. One can show inductively that all vertices are identified to a single vertex $v$. If $\partial$ is the boundary homomorphism, then $\partial_0 = \partial_1 = 0$. Since there’s only one vertex, it follows that $H_0 = \mathbb{Z}$.

Also, by the identifications, the set of 1-boundaries is generated by $[a_0, a_1, \ldots , a_n]$. One can compute that if $\Delta_i^2$ is the $i$th simplex, then $\partial_2(\Delta_0^2) = a_0$, and $\partial_2(\Delta_i^2) = 2a_i - a_{i-1}$ for all $i$. Thus, the image is generated by $[a_0, 2a_1 - a_0, \ldots , 2a_n - a_{n-1}] = [a_0, 2a_1, 2a_2 - a_1, \ldots , 2a_n - a_{n-1}]$.

Since $\partial_1 = 0$, the kernel is $[a_0, \ldots , a_n]$. So this representation of the image implies $2a_2 = a_1$ in the quotient, and also $2a_1 = 0$. Thus $4a_2 = 0$. Inductively, $2^k a_i = 0$. Conclusion: $H_1 = \mathbb{Z}/(2^n)\mathbb{Z}$.

With the generators $a_i$, one can show that the kernel of $\partial_2$ is $0$, so $H_2 = 0$. Of course, $H_k = 0$ for $k > 2$.

Compute the simplicial homology groups of the $\Delta$-complex obtained from $n+1$ 2-simplices $\Delta_0^2, \cdots, \Delta_n^2$ by identifying all three edges of $\Delta_0^2$ to a single edge, and for $i>0$ identifying the edges $[v_0, v_1]$ and $[v_1, v_2]$ of $\Delta_i^2$ to a single edge and the edge $[v_0, v_2]$ to the edge $[v_0, v_1]$ of $\Delta_{i-1}^2$.

Construct a 3-dimensional $\Delta$-complex $X$ from $n$ tetrahedra $T_1, \cdots, T_n$ by the following two steps. First arrange the tetrahedra in a cyclic pattern as in the figure, so that each $T_i$ shares a common vertical face with its two neighbors $T_{i-1}$ and $T_{i+1}$, subscripts being taken $\bmod n$. Then identify the bottom face of $T_i$ with the top face of $T_{i+1}$ for each $i$. Show the simplicial homology groups of $X$ in dimensions $0,1,2,3$ are $\mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Z}_n, 0, \mathbb{Z}$, respectively. [The space $X$ is an example of a lens space; see Example 2.43 for the general case.]
