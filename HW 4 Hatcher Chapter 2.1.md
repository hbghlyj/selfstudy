What familiar space is the quotient $\Delta$-complex of a 2-simplex $[v_0, v_1, v_2]$ obtained by identifying the edges $[v_0, v_1]$ and $[v_1, v_2]$, preserving the ordering of vertices?

Proof

The quotient $\Delta$-complex is homeomorphic to a Möbius strip. By identifying the edges $[v_0, v_1]$ and $[v_1, v_2]$ while preserving the vertex ordering, we create a twist in the surface, resulting in a non-orientable surface with a single boundary component, which is characteristic of a Möbius strip.

Construct a $\Delta$-complex structure on $\mathbb{RP}^n$ as a quotient of a $\Delta$-complex structure on $S^n$ having vertices the two vectors of length 1 along each coordinate axis in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$.

Proof

A $\Delta$-complex structure on $S^n$ can be constructed using $2^{n+1}$ n-simplices, each corresponding to a choice of sign for each coordinate axis in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. The vertices of these simplices are the unit vectors along each coordinate axis, both positive and negative. To obtain a $\Delta$-complex structure on $\mathbb{RP}^n$, we identify antipodal points on $S^n$. This identification pairs each simplex with its antipodal counterpart, effectively halving the number of simplices in the quotient space. The resulting $\Delta$-complex structure on $\mathbb{RP}^n$ consists of $2^n$ n-simplices, with vertices corresponding to the lines through the origin in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ defined by the unit vectors along each coordinate axis.

Compute the simplicial homology groups of the $\Delta$-complex obtained from $n+1$ 2-simplices $\Delta_0^2, \cdots, \Delta_n^2$ by identifying all three edges of $\Delta_0^2$ to a single edge, and for $i>0$ identifying the edges $[v_0, v_1]$ and $[v_1, v_2]$ of $\Delta_i^2$ to a single edge and the edge $[v_0, v_2]$ to the edge $[v_0, v_1]$ of $\Delta_{i-1}^2$.

Construct a 3-dimensional $\Delta$-complex $X$ from $n$ tetrahedra $T_1, \cdots, T_n$ by the following two steps. First arrange the tetrahedra in a cyclic pattern as in the figure, so that each $T_i$ shares a common vertical face with its two neighbors $T_{i-1}$ and $T_{i+1}$, subscripts being taken $\bmod n$. Then identify the bottom face of $T_i$ with the top face of $T_{i+1}$ for each $i$. Show the simplicial homology groups of $X$ in dimensions $0,1,2,3$ are $\mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Z}_n, 0, \mathbb{Z}$, respectively. [The space $X$ is an example of a lens space; see Example 2.43 for the general case.]
