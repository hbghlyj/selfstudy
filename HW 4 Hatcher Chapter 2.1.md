What familiar space is the quotient $\Delta$-complex of a 2-simplex $[v_0, v_1, v_2]$ obtained by identifying the edges $[v_0, v_1]$ and $[v_1, v_2]$, preserving the ordering of vertices?

Proof

The quotient $\Delta$-complex is homeomorphic to a Möbius strip. By identifying the edges $[v_0, v_1]$ and $[v_1, v_2]$ while preserving the vertex ordering, we create a twist in the surface, resulting in a non-orientable surface with a single boundary component, which is characteristic of a Möbius strip.

Construct a $\Delta$-complex structure on $\mathbb{RP}^n$ as a quotient of a $\Delta$-complex structure on $S^n$ having vertices the two vectors of length 1 along each coordinate axis in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$.

Proof

To construct a $\Delta$-complex structure on $\mathbb{RP}^n$, we start with a convenient $\Delta$-complex structure on $S^n$. We view $S^n$ as being homeomorphic to the boundary of the $(n+1)$-dimensional cross-polytope, which is the set of points in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ satisfying the equation $|x_0| + |x_1| + \cdots + |x_n| = 1$.

This representation decomposes $S^n$ into $2^{n+1}$ n-simplices, each corresponding to a unique combination of signs for the coordinates $(x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_n)$. The set of vertices for this entire $\Delta$-complex consists of the unit vectors along each coordinate axis, both positive and negative.

To obtain a $\Delta$-complex structure on $\mathbb{RP}^n$, we identify antipodal points on $S^n$. This identification pairs each simplex with its antipodal counterpart, effectively halving the number of simplices in the quotient space. The resulting $\Delta$-complex structure on $\mathbb{RP}^n$ consists of $2^n$ n-simplices, with vertices corresponding to the lines through the origin in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ defined by the unit vectors along each coordinate axis.

Compute the simplicial homology groups of the triangular parachute obtained from $\Delta^2$ by identifying its three vertices to a single point.

Proof

The triangular parachute has one 2-simplex, three 1-simplices (the edges of the triangle), and one 0-simplex (the identified vertex).

- The boundary of the 2-simplex is $[v_1, v_2] - [v_0, v_2] + [v_0, v_1]$. $\ker(\partial_2) = 0$ and $\mathrm{im}(\partial_2) = \langle [v_1, v_2] - [v_0, v_2] + [v_0, v_1] \rangle$.

- The boundary of each 1-simplex is $\partial([v_i, v_j]) = v_j - v_i$. Since all vertices are identified, $\partial([v_i, v_j]) = 0$. Thus, $\ker(\partial_1) = \langle [v_0, v_1], [v_1, v_2], [v_0, v_2] \rangle$ and $\mathrm{im}(\partial_1) = 0$.

Calculating the homology groups:

- $H_2 = \ker(\partial_2) / \mathrm{im}(\partial_3) = 0 / 0 = 0$.
- $H_1 = \ker(\partial_1) / \mathrm{im}(\partial_2) = \langle [v_0, v_1], [v_1, v_2], [v_0, v_2] \rangle / \langle [v_1, v_2] - [v_0, v_2] + [v_0, v_1] \rangle \cong \mathbb{Z}^2$, since the relation reduces the number of free generators for the group from three to two.
- $H_0 = \ker(\partial_0) / \mathrm{im}(\partial_1) = \mathbb{Z} / 0 \cong \mathbb{Z}$.

Compute the simplicial homology groups of the $\Delta$-complex obtained from $n+1$ 2-simplices $\Delta_0^2, \cdots, \Delta_n^2$ by identifying all three edges of $\Delta_0^2$ to a single edge, and for $i>0$ identifying the edges $[v_0, v_1]$ and $[v_1, v_2]$ of $\Delta_i^2$ to a single edge and the edge $[v_0, v_2]$ to the edge $[v_0, v_1]$ of $\Delta_{i-1}^2$.

Proof

Let $a_i, b_i, c_i$ be the edges $[v_0, v_1], [v_1, v_2], [v_0, v_2]$ respectively of each $\Delta_i^2$. Then $a_0 = b_0 = c_0$, and for $i>0$, $a_i = b_i$ and $c_i = a_{i-1}$. One can show inductively that all vertices are identified to a single vertex $v$. If $\partial$ is the boundary homomorphism, then $\partial_0 = \partial_1 = 0$. Since there’s only one vertex, it follows that $H_0 = \mathbb{Z}$.

Also, by the identifications, the 1-chain group $C_1$ is generated by $\{a_0, a_1, \ldots , a_n\}$. One can compute that the boundary map $\partial_2$ is given by $\partial_2(\Delta_0^2) = a_0$ and $\partial_2(\Delta_i^2) = 2a_i - a_{i-1}$ for $i>0$.

Since $\partial_1 = 0$, $H_1 = C_1/\mathrm{im}(\partial_2)$. The relations defining the quotient group are $a_0=0$ and $a_{i-1}=2a_i$ for $i=1, \ldots, n$. These relations imply $a_0 = 2a_1 = 4a_2 = \dots = 2^n a_n$. As $a_0=0$, we have $2^n a_n = 0$. The group is generated by $a_n$ and is therefore cyclic of order $2^n$. Thus, $H_1 \cong \mathbb{Z}/2^n\mathbb{Z}$.

The kernel of $\partial_2$ is trivial. For a 2-chain $\sum c_i \Delta_i^2$, its boundary is $(c_0-c_1)a_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (2c_i-c_{i+1})a_i + 2c_n a_n$. Setting this to 0 forces all $c_i=0$, starting from $c_n$. Thus $H_2 = 0$. Of course, $H_k = 0$ for $k > 2$.

Construct a 3-dimensional $\Delta$-complex $X$ from $n$ tetrahedra $T_1, \cdots, T_n$ by the following two steps. First arrange the tetrahedra in a cyclic pattern as in the figure, so that each $T_i$ shares a common vertical face with its two neighbors $T_{i-1}$ and $T_{i+1}$, subscripts being taken $\bmod n$. Then identify the bottom face of $T_i$ with the top face of $T_{i+1}$ for each $i$. Show the simplicial homology groups of $X$ in dimensions $0,1,2,3$ are $\mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Z}_n, 0, \mathbb{Z}$, respectively. [The space $X$ is an example of a lens space; see Example 2.43 for the general case.]

![](https://riemannianhunger.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/hatcher-2-1-8.png)

Proof

1. After Step 1 (Cyclic Arrangement)
First, we arrange the n tetrahedra $T_i = [v_N, v_S, e_i, e_{i+1}]$ in a cycle. This identifies the vertical face $[v_N, v_S, e_i]$ of $T_i$ with the corresponding face on $T_{i-1}$.

At this stage, we have n+2 vertices (v 
N
​
 , v 
S
​
 , and e 
1
​
 ,…,e 
n
​
 ) and the following 3n+1 edges:

Axis Edge (1): All n internal edges [v 
N
​
 ,v 
S
​
 ] are identified into 1 edge.

Top Spoke Edges (n): As you noted, the n edges connecting the top pole to the rim ([v 
N
​
 ,e 
i
​
 ]) are shared between adjacent top faces. This gives n distinct edges.

Bottom Spoke Edges (n): Similarly, the n edges connecting the bottom pole to the rim ([v 
S
​
 ,e 
i
​
 ]) give n distinct edges.

Rim Edges (n): The n edges [e 
i
​
 ,e 
i+1
​
 ] forming the outer rim. These give n distinct edges.

Total before Step 2: 1+n+n+n=3n+1 edges.

2. After Step 2 (Final Identification)
Now, we apply the second identification: "identify the bottom face of T 
i
​
  with the top face of T 
i+1
​
 ."

This map f:Bottom(T 
i
​
 )→Top(T 
i+1
​
 ) identifies the vertices and edges of these faces.

Vertices: v 
S
​
 ∼v 
N
​
  (poles merge) and e 
i
​
 ∼e 
i+1
​
  (all rim vertices merge). This leaves 2 vertices.

Edges: This map forces new edge identifications on our 3n+1 edges.

Let's see what happens to each group:

Axis Edge:

The axis edge [v 
N
​
 ,v 
S
​
 ] is not part of any face being glued.

Its endpoints v 
N
​
  and v 
S
​
  are identified, so it just becomes a loop.

It is not identified with any other edge.

Result: 1 edge

Rim Edges:

The map identifies the bottom rim edge of T 
i
​
  (which is R 
i
​
 =[e 
i
​
 ,e 
i+1
​
 ]) with the top rim edge of T 
i+1
​
  (which is R 
i+1
​
 =[e 
i+1
​
 ,e 
i+2
​
 ]).

This creates the chain of identifications R 
1
​
 ∼R 
2
​
 ∼⋯∼R 
n
​
 ∼R 
1
​
 .

All n rim edges are identified into a single equivalence class (a loop).

Result: 1 edge

Spoke Edges:

This is the key part. The map identifies the bottom spokes of T 
i
​
  with the top spokes of T 
i+1
​
 .

Specifically, the bottom spoke [v 
S
​
 ,e 
i
​
 ] (from Bottom(T 
i
​
 )) is identified with the top spoke [v 
N
​
 ,e 
i+1
​
 ] (from Top(T 
i+1
​
 )).

This gives the relation: BottomSpoke 
i
​
 ∼TopSpoke 
i+1
​
  for all i=1,…,n.

This links the 2n total spoke edges into n pairs. For example, if n=4:

BottomSpoke 
1
​
 ∼TopSpoke 
2
​
 

BottomSpoke 
2
​
 ∼TopSpoke 
3
​
 

BottomSpoke 
3
​
 ∼TopSpoke 
4
​
 

BottomSpoke 
4
​
 ∼TopSpoke 
1
​
 

These are n distinct equivalence classes.

Result: n edges

Final Count
Adding them all up, the total number of edges after all identifications is:

1 (from the axis)

1 (from the rim edges)

n (from the spoke edges)

Total = n+2 edges
