What familiar space is the quotient -complex of a 2-simplex $[v_0, v_1, v_2][v_0, v_1][v_1, v_2]$, preserving the ordering of vertices?

Proof

The quotient -complex is homeomorphic to a Möbius strip. By identifying the edges $[v_0, v_1][v_1, v_2]$ while preserving the vertex ordering, we create a twist in the surface, resulting in a non-orientable surface with a single boundary component, which is characteristic of a Möbius strip.

Construct a -complex structure on  as a quotient of a -complex structure on  having vertices the two vectors of length 1 along each coordinate axis in .

Proof

To construct a -complex structure on , we start with a convenient -complex structure on . We view  as being homeomorphic to the boundary of the  -dimensional cross-polytope, which is the set of points in  satisfying the equation     .

This representation decomposes  into  n-simplices, each corresponding to a unique combination of signs for the coordinates . The set of vertices for this entire -complex consists of the unit vectors along each coordinate axis, both positive and negative.

To obtain a -complex structure on , we identify antipodal points on . This identification pairs each simplex with its antipodal counterpart, effectively halving the number of simplices in the quotient space. The resulting -complex structure on  consists of  n-simplices, with vertices corresponding to the lines through the origin in  defined by the unit vectors along each coordinate axis.

Compute the simplicial homology groups of the triangular parachute obtained from  by identifying its three vertices to a single point.

Proof

The triangular parachute has one 2-simplex, three 1-simplices (the edges of the triangle), and one 0-simplex (the identified vertex).

- The boundary of the 2-simplex is   .   and    .

- The boundary of each 1-simplex is   . Since all vertices are identified,  . Thus,   and  .

Calculating the homology groups:

Compute the simplicial homology groups of the -complex obtained from   2-simplices  by identifying all three edges of  to a single edge, and for   identifying the edges  and  of  to a single edge and the edge  to the edge  of .

Proof

Let  be the edges  respectively of each . Then   , and for  ,   and  . One can show inductively that all vertices are identified to a single vertex . If  is the boundary homomorphism, then   . Since there’s only one vertex, it follows that  .

Also, by the identifications, the 1-chain group  is generated by . One can compute that the boundary map  is given by   and    for  .

Since  ,  . The relations defining the quotient group are   and   for  . These relations imply     . As  , we have  . The group is generated by  and is therefore cyclic of order . Thus,  .

The kernel of $\partial_2$ is trivial. For a 2-chain $\sum c_i \Delta_i^2$, its boundary is $(c_0-c_1)a_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (2c_i-c_{i+1})a_i + 2c_n a_n$. Setting this to 0 forces all $c_i=0$, starting from $c_n$. Thus $H_2 = 0$. Of course, $H_k = 0$ for $k > 2$.

Construct a 3-dimensional $\Delta$-complex $X$ from $n$ tetrahedra $T_1, \cdots, T_n$ by the following two steps. First arrange the tetrahedra in a cyclic pattern as in the figure, so that each $T_i$ shares a common vertical face with its two neighbors $T_{i-1}$ and $T_{i+1}$, subscripts being taken $\bmod n$. Then identify the bottom face of $T_i$ with the top face of $T_{i+1}$ for each $i$. Show the simplicial homology groups of $X$ in dimensions $0,1,2,3$ are $\mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Z}_n, 0, \mathbb{Z}$, respectively. [The space $X$ is an example of a lens space; see Example 2.43 for the general case.]

Proof

* Axis Edge:

  The axis edge $A=[v_S, v_N]$ is not part of any face being glued.

  Its endpoints $v_N$ and $v_S$ are identified, so it just becomes a loop.

  It is not identified with any other edge.

* Rim Edges:

  The map identifies the bottom rim edge of $T_i$ (which is $R_i = [e_i, e_{i+1}]$) with the top rim edge of $T_{i+1}$ (which is $R_{i+1} = [e_{i+1}, e_{i+2}]$).

  This creates the chain of identifications $R_1 \sim R_2 \sim \cdots \sim R_n \sim R_1$.

  All $n$ rim edges are identified into a single equivalence class (a loop), labeled $R$.

* Spoke Edges:

  The map identifies the bottom spokes of $T_i$ with the top spokes of $T_{i+1}$.

  Specifically, the bottom spoke $[e_i,v_S]$ from $T_i$ is identified with the top spoke $[e_{i+1},v_N]$ from $T_{i+1}$.

  This gives the relation: $`\text{BottomSpoke}_i \sim \text{TopSpoke}_{i+1}`$ for all i=1,…,n.
  This links the $2n$ total spoke edges into n pairs.

  These are $n$ distinct equivalence classes.

  Result: $n$ edges, with the class $[e_i,v_S]\sim[e_{i+1},v_N]$ labeled as $S_i$.

Boundary maps:

* $\partial_2([e_i,v_N,v_S]) = - A - S_i + S_{i-1}$
* $\partial_2([e_i,e_{i+1},v_N]) = R + S_i - S_{i-1}$
* $\partial_3([e_i,e_{i+1},v_S,v_N]) = [e_{i+1},v_S,v_N] - [e_i,v_S,v_N] + [e_i,e_{i+1},v_N] - [e_i,e_{i+1},v_S]$

Calculating homology groups:
- $H_0(X) = \mathbb{Z}$ since there is one vertex after identifications.
- $H_1(X) = \mathbb{Z}_n$. The calculation is as follows:

  $`\begin{aligned}
  H_1(X) &= \frac{\langle A,R,S_i\rangle}{\langle- A - S_i + S_{i-1}, R + S_i - S_{i-1}\rangle} \\
         &= \frac{\langle A,R,S_i\rangle}{\langle- A - S_i + S_{i-1}, R-A\rangle} \\
         &= \frac{\langle A,S_i\rangle}{\langle- A - S_i + S_{i-1}\rangle} \\
         &= \frac{\langle A\rangle}{\langle nA\rangle} \cong \mathbb{Z}_n
  \end{aligned}`$
- $H_2(X) = 0$ as $\ker(\partial_2) = \mathrm{im}(\partial_3)$.
- $H_3(X) = \mathbb{Z}$ since $\ker(\partial_3)$ is generated by the cycle $\sum_{i=1}^n T_i$.

  Show the quotient space of a finite collection of disjoint 2-simplices obtained by identifying pairs of edges is always a surface, locally homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^2$.
</li>
<li>
  
  Show the edges can always be oriented so as to define a $\Delta$-complex structure on the quotient surface. [This is more difficult.]
</li>
</ol>

Proof

<ol type="a">
<li>
  
  *   **Interior of a 2-cell:** An open neighborhood is contained entirely within the 2-simplex, which is homeomorphic to a disk in $\mathbb{R}^2$.
  *   **Interior of a 1-cell:** A point on an edge has a neighborhood formed by gluing two half-disks from adjacent 2-simplices, which results in a space homeomorphic to a disk.
  *   **0-cell (vertex):** A neighborhood is formed by sectors of disks from all incident 2-simplices. Since edges are identified in pairs, these sectors fit together around the vertex to form a complete disk.
</li>
<li>

  To orient the edges consistently, we can proceed as follows:

  1. **Choose an initial orientation:** Start with one 2-simplex and assign an arbitrary orientation to its edges.
  2. **Propagate orientations:** For each edge that is identified with another edge, ensure that the orientations are compatible. If two edges are identified, they must have opposite orientations to maintain consistency in the quotient space.
  3. **Check for consistency:** As we propagate orientations through the identifications, we must ensure that no contradictions arise. If a contradiction occurs, we may need to reverse the orientation of some edges to restore consistency.
  4. **Complete the process:** Continue this process until all edges in the quotient space have been assigned orientations that are consistent with the identifications.

  By following these steps, we can ensure that the resulting quotient space has a well-defined $\Delta$-complex structure with oriented edges.
