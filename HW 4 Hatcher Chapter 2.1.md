What familiar space is the quotient $\Delta$-complex of a 2-simplex $[v_0, v_1, v_2]$ obtained by identifying the edges $[v_0, v_1]$ and $[v_1, v_2]$, preserving the ordering of vertices?

Proof

The quotient space is homeomorphic to a Möbius strip. The identification of the oriented edges $[v_0, v_1] \sim [v_1, v_2]$ implies the identification of their vertices, so $v_0 \sim v_1$ and $v_1 \sim v_2$. Consequently, all three vertices $v_0, v_1, v_2$ are identified to a single point. The boundary of the resulting space is the image of the edge $[v_2, v_0]$. Since its endpoints $v_0$ and $v_2$ are identified, the boundary is a single circle. This means the space is a surface with one boundary component. The identification of two adjacent boundary edges, $[v_0, v_1]$ and $[v_1, v_2]$, as one traverses the boundary of the 2-simplex introduces a twist, making the surface non-orientable. The simplest non-orientable surface with one boundary component is the Möbius strip.

Construct a $\Delta$-complex structure on $\mathbb{RP}^n$ as a quotient of a $\Delta$-complex structure on $S^n$ having vertices the two vectors of length 1 along each coordinate axis in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$.

Proof

To construct a $\Delta$-complex structure on $\mathbb{RP}^n$, we start with a convenient $\Delta$-complex structure on $S^n$. We view $S^n$ as being homeomorphic to the boundary of the $(n+1)$-dimensional cross-polytope, which is the set of points in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ satisfying the equation $|x_0| + |x_1| + \cdots + |x_n| = 1$.

This representation decomposes $S^n$ into $2^{n+1}$ n-simplices, each corresponding to a unique combination of signs for the coordinates $(x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_n)$. The set of vertices for this entire $\Delta$-complex consists of the unit vectors along each coordinate axis, both positive and negative.

To obtain a $\Delta$-complex structure on $\mathbb{RP}^n$, we identify antipodal points on $S^n$. This identification pairs each simplex with its antipodal counterpart, effectively halving the number of simplices in the quotient space. The resulting $\Delta$-complex structure on $\mathbb{RP}^n$ consists of $2^n$ n-simplices, with vertices corresponding to the lines through the origin in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ defined by the unit vectors along each coordinate axis.

Compute the simplicial homology groups of the triangular parachute obtained from $\Delta^2$ by identifying its three vertices to a single point.

Proof

The triangular parachute has one 2-simplex, three 1-simplices (the edges of the triangle), and one 0-simplex (the identified vertex).

- The boundary of the 2-simplex is $[v_1, v_2] - [v_0, v_2] + [v_0, v_1]$. $\ker(\partial_2) = 0$ and $\mathrm{im}(\partial_2) = \langle [v_1, v_2] - [v_0, v_2] + [v_0, v_1] \rangle$.

- The boundary of each 1-simplex is $\partial([v_i, v_j]) = v_j - v_i$. Since all vertices are identified, $\partial([v_i, v_j]) = 0$. Thus, $\ker(\partial_1) = \langle [v_0, v_1], [v_1, v_2], [v_0, v_2] \rangle$ and $\mathrm{im}(\partial_1) = 0$.

Calculating the homology groups:

- $H_2 = \ker(\partial_2) / \mathrm{im}(\partial_3) = 0 / 0 = 0$.
- $H_1 = \ker(\partial_1) / \mathrm{im}(\partial_2) = \langle [v_0, v_1], [v_1, v_2], [v_0, v_2] \rangle / \langle [v_1, v_2] - [v_0, v_2] + [v_0, v_1] \rangle \cong \mathbb{Z}^2$, since the relation reduces the number of free generators for the group from three to two.
- $H_0 = \ker(\partial_0) / \mathrm{im}(\partial_1) = \mathbb{Z} / 0 \cong \mathbb{Z}$.

Compute the simplicial homology groups of the $\Delta$-complex obtained from $n+1$ 2-simplices $\Delta_0^2, \cdots, \Delta_n^2$ by identifying all three edges of $\Delta_0^2$ to a single edge, and for $i>0$ identifying the edges $[v_0, v_1]$ and $[v_1, v_2]$ of $\Delta_i^2$ to a single edge and the edge $[v_0, v_2]$ to the edge $[v_0, v_1]$ of $\Delta_{i-1}^2$.

Proof

Let $a_i, b_i, c_i$ be the edges $[v_0, v_1], [v_1, v_2], [v_0, v_2]$ respectively of each $\Delta_i^2$. Then $a_0 = b_0 = c_0$, and for $i>0$, $a_i = b_i$ and $c_i = a_{i-1}$. One can show inductively that all vertices are identified to a single vertex $v$. If $\partial$ is the boundary homomorphism, then $\partial_0 = \partial_1 = 0$. Since there’s only one vertex, it follows that $H_0 = \mathbb{Z}$.

Also, by the identifications, the 1-chain group $C_1$ is generated by $\{a_0, a_1, \ldots , a_n\}$. One can compute that the boundary map $\partial_2$ is given by $\partial_2(\Delta_0^2) = a_0$ and $\partial_2(\Delta_i^2) = 2a_i - a_{i-1}$ for $i>0$.

Since $\partial_1 = 0$, $H_1 = C_1/\mathrm{im}(\partial_2)$. The relations defining the quotient group are $a_0=0$ and $a_{i-1}=2a_i$ for $i=1, \ldots, n$. These relations imply $a_0 = 2a_1 = 4a_2 = \dots = 2^n a_n$. As $a_0=0$, we have $2^n a_n = 0$. The group is generated by $a_n$ and is therefore cyclic of order $2^n$. Thus, $H_1 \cong \mathbb{Z}/2^n\mathbb{Z}$.

The kernel of $\partial_2$ is trivial. For a 2-chain $\sum c_i \Delta_i^2$, its boundary is $(c_0-c_1)a_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (2c_i-c_{i+1})a_i + 2c_n a_n$. Setting this to 0 forces all $c_i=0$, starting from $c_n$. Thus $H_2 = 0$. Of course, $H_k = 0$ for $k > 2$.

Construct a 3-dimensional $\Delta$-complex $X$ from $n$ tetrahedra $T_1, \cdots, T_n$ by the following two steps. First arrange the tetrahedra in a cyclic pattern as in the figure, so that each $T_i$ shares a common vertical face with its two neighbors $T_{i-1}$ and $T_{i+1}$, subscripts being taken $\bmod n$. Then identify the bottom face of $T_i$ with the top face of $T_{i+1}$ for each $i$. Show the simplicial homology groups of $X$ in dimensions $0,1,2,3$ are $\mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Z}_n, 0, \mathbb{Z}$, respectively. [The space $X$ is an example of a lens space; see Example 2.43 for the general case.]

Proof

* Axis Edge:

  The axis edge $A=[v_S, v_N]$ is not part of any face being glued.

  Its endpoints $v_N$ and $v_S$ are identified, so it just becomes a loop.

  It is not identified with any other edge.

* Rim Edges:

  The map identifies the bottom rim edge of $T_i$ (which is $R_i = [e_i, e_{i+1}]$) with the top rim edge of $T_{i+1}$ (which is $R_{i+1} = [e_{i+1}, e_{i+2}]$).

  This creates the chain of identifications $R_1 \sim R_2 \sim \cdots \sim R_n \sim R_1$.

  All $n$ rim edges are identified into a single equivalence class (a loop), labeled $R$.

* Spoke Edges:

  The map identifies the bottom spokes of $T_i$ with the top spokes of $T_{i+1}$.

  Specifically, the bottom spoke $[e_i,v_S]$ from $T_i$ is identified with the top spoke $[e_{i+1},v_N]$ from $T_{i+1}$.

  This gives the relation: $`\text{BottomSpoke}_i \sim \text{TopSpoke}_{i+1}`$ for all i=1,…,n.
  This links the $2n$ total spoke edges into n pairs.

  These are $n$ distinct equivalence classes.

  Result: $n$ edges, with the class $[e_i,v_S]\sim[e_{i+1},v_N]$ labeled as $S_i$.

Boundary maps:

* $\partial_2([e_i,v_N,v_S]) = - A - S_i + S_{i-1}$
* $\partial_2([e_i,e_{i+1},v_N]) = R + S_i - S_{i-1}$
* $\partial_3([e_i,e_{i+1},v_S,v_N]) = [e_{i+1},v_S,v_N] - [e_i,v_S,v_N] + [e_i,e_{i+1},v_N] - [e_i,e_{i+1},v_S]$

Calculating homology groups:
- $H_0(X) = \mathbb{Z}$ since there is one vertex after identifications.
- $H_1(X) = \mathbb{Z}_n$. The calculation is as follows:

  $`\begin{aligned}
  H_1(X) &= \frac{\langle A,R,S_i\rangle}{\langle- A - S_i + S_{i-1}, R + S_i - S_{i-1}\rangle} \\
         &= \frac{\langle A,R,S_i\rangle}{\langle- A - S_i + S_{i-1}, R-A\rangle} \\
         &= \frac{\langle A,S_i\rangle}{\langle- A - S_i + S_{i-1}\rangle} \\
         &= \frac{\langle A\rangle}{\langle nA\rangle} \cong \mathbb{Z}_n
  \end{aligned}`$
- $H_2(X) = 0$ as $\ker(\partial_2) = \mathrm{im}(\partial_3)$.
- $H_3(X) = \mathbb{Z}$ since $\ker(\partial_3)$ is generated by the cycle $\sum_{i=1}^n T_i$.

  Show the quotient space of a finite collection of disjoint 2-simplices obtained by identifying pairs of edges is always a surface, locally homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^2$.
</li>
<li>
  
  Show the edges can always be oriented so as to define a $\Delta$-complex structure on the quotient surface. [This is more difficult.]
</li>
</ol>

Proof

<ol type="a">
<li>
  
  *   **Interior of a 2-cell:** An open neighborhood is contained entirely within the 2-simplex, which is homeomorphic to a disk in $\mathbb{R}^2$.
  *   **Interior of a 1-cell:** A point on an edge has a neighborhood formed by gluing two half-disks from adjacent 2-simplices, which results in a space homeomorphic to a disk.
  *   **0-cell (vertex):** A neighborhood is formed by sectors of disks from all incident 2-simplices. Since edges are identified in pairs, these sectors fit together around the vertex to form a complete disk.

  To define the $\Delta$-complex structure, we must define the oriented simplices. We can proceed as follows:

  1. **Orient edges:** The edges of the quotient space are the equivalence classes of edges from the original 2-simplices. For each class, choose an arbitrary orientation. This defines all the 1-simplices.

  2. **Orient faces:** The faces of the quotient space are the images of the original 2-simplices. For each face, choose an arbitrary orientation by ordering its vertices. This defines all the 2-simplices.

  3. **Define boundary maps:** The orientation of a 2-simplex induces an orientation on its boundary edges. The boundary of each 2-simplex is then a formal sum of its three edge 1-simplices. The sign of each term is positive if the induced orientation matches the orientation chosen in step 1, and negative otherwise.

  This procedure always yields a valid $\Delta$-complex structure. The fact that the quotient space is a surface (as established in part (a)) is crucial. It guarantees that the local identifications are well-behaved and locally Euclidean, which ensures that the characteristic maps can be consistently defined and that the boundary of a boundary is always zero, thus satisfying all axioms of a $\Delta$-complex.
