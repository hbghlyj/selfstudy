# Exercise 1
Show that a topological manifold is the same thing as a $C^0$ manifold.

Proof

# Exercise 2
Check that the definition of a smooth function makes sense on a smooth manifold.

Proof

# Exercise 3
Write down (with proof) a smooth structure on the MÃ¶bius strip.

Proof

# Exercise 4
The stereographic projection maps on $S^n$ are given by

$X \mapsto x=\frac{1}{1-X^{n+1}}\left(X^1, \ldots, X^n\right), \quad X \mapsto y=\frac{1}{1+X^{n+1}}\left(X^1, \ldots, X^n\right)$

from the north and south poles respectively.

The inverse stereographic projection is given by

$x \mapsto X=\frac{1}{1+|x|^2}\left(2 x^1, \ldots, 2 x^n,|x|^2-1\right)$

Derive the formula for the transition map

$x \mapsto y=\frac{x}{|x|^2}$

Proof

# Exercise 5
Check that the smooth structure on $S^n$ induced by the stereographic charts is equivalent to the smooth structure induced by the hemisphere charts.

Proof

# Exercise 6
Show that $\mathbb{CP}^n$ is a compact smooth manifold. (Part of this is in [Waldron's notes](https://people.math.wisc.edu/~awaldron3/Notes/761%20notes%20final.pdf).)

Proof
