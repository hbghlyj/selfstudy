1. True or false: For any $n \times n$ matrix, the $n$-th power of its minimal polynomial is divisible by the characteristic polynomial.

    True. Let $p(x)$ and $m(x)$ be the characteristic and minimal polynomials. Let $\lambda$ be an eigenvalue with algebraic multiplicity $a$ and multiplicity $b$ in $m(x)$. We know $1 \le b \le a$. For $p(x)$ to divide $(m(x))^n$, we need $a \le nb$ for all eigenvalues. Since the total dimension is $n$, $a \le n$. Also, since $b \ge 1$, $n \le nb$. Thus $a \le n \le nb$, and the statement is true.
2. Up to similarity, how many $5 \times 5$ matrices have minimal polynomial $x^3-x^2$?

    Consider the possible Jordan canonical forms that satisfy this minimal polynomial and the matrix dimension. Each distinct Jordan canonical form corresponds to a unique similarity class.
    The minimal polynomial $m(x) = x^3-x^2 = x^2(x-1)$ gives the following constraints:
    *   The eigenvalues are 0 and 1.
    *   The largest Jordan block for $\lambda=0$ must be of size 2.
    *   All Jordan blocks for $\lambda=1$ must be of size 1.

    Since the matrix is $5 \times 5$, the sum of the sizes of all Jordan blocks must be 5. Let $a_0$ be the algebraic multiplicity of $\lambda=0$ and $a_1$ be that of $\lambda=1$. We have $a_0+a_1=5$. The constraints require $a_0 \ge 2$ and $a_1 \ge 1$, so $`a_0 \in \{2, 3, 4\}`$.

    The possible partitions of block sizes are:
    | $a_0$ | Partitions for $\lambda=0$ | $a_1$ | Partitions for $\lambda=1$ |
    |:-----:|:--------------------------:|:-----:|:--------------------------:|
    | 2     | (2)                        | 3     | (1, 1, 1)                  |
    | 3     | (2, 1)                     | 2     | (1, 1)                     |
    | 4     | (2, 2)                     | 1     | (1)                        |
    | 4     | (2, 1, 1)                  | 1     | (1)                        |

    This gives a total of 4 distinct similarity classes.
4. Give an example of a vector space $V \neq 0$ over $\mathbb{C}$ and an operator $\phi: V \rightarrow V$ such that $\phi$ does not have any eigenvalues.

   Let $V = \mathbb{C}[x]$ be the vector space of polynomials with complex coefficients. Define the operator $\phi: V \rightarrow V$ by $\phi(p(x)) = x \cdot p(x)$.

   If $\phi(p) = \lambda p$ for some $p \neq 0$ and $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}$, then $x p(x) = \lambda p(x)$. Comparing degrees, we get $\deg(p) + 1 = \deg(p)$, which is impossible. Thus, $\phi$ has no eigenvalues.
5. Give an example of a group $G$ and a representation of $G$ that is not completely reducible.

    The representation $ρ:\mathbb{Z}→GL_2(\mathbb C)$ where $`ρ(1)=\begin{pmatrix}1&1\\0&1\end{pmatrix}`$ is not completely reducible. Another example is $\mathbb{Z}_2$'s regular representation when the field's characteristic is 2.

6. True or false: If $V$ is a real representation of a finite group $G$, then any quotient representation $V / W$ (for an invariant subspace $W$) is isomorphic to a subrepresentation of $V$.

   True. Since $G$ is finite and the representation is over $\mathbb{R}$ (a field of characteristic 0), we can average over the group to construct a $G$-invariant complement to $W$. This requires dividing by $|G|$, which is valid in $\mathbb{R}$. This complement is isomorphic to the quotient $V/W$, which is therefore isomorphic to a subrepresentation of $V$.

   
# 2.
Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional vector space (over some field) and $\phi: V \rightarrow V$ an operator. Suppose $W \subset V$ is an invariant subspace, so we can consider $\phi$ as an operator on three spaces: $V, W$, and $V / W$. Denote their minimal polynomials by $m_V, m_W$, and $m_{V / W}$, and their characteristic polynomials by $p_V, p_W$, and $p_{V / W}$ respectively.
1. Show that $p_V=p_W \cdot p_{V / W}$;
    
    Proof
    
    By definition, the characteristic polynomial of an operator is independent of the choice of basis. Since $W$ is an invariant subspace, we can choose a basis for $V$ that extends a basis for $W$. With respect to such a basis, the matrix of $\phi$ (let's call it $A$) has the block upper-triangular form:
    
    $`A = \begin{pmatrix}A_W & * \\ 0 & A_{V/W} \end{pmatrix}`$
    
    where $A_W$ is the matrix of the restriction of $\phi$ to $W$, and $A_{V/W}$ is the matrix of the induced operator on $V/W$.
    
    The characteristic polynomial of $\phi$ is then computed using this matrix:
   
    $`p_V(t) = \det(tI - A) = \det\begin{pmatrix}tI_W - A_W & -* \\ 0 & tI_{V/W} - A_{V/W}\end{pmatrix} = \det(tI_W - A_W) \cdot \det(tI_{V/W} - A_{V/W}) = p_W(t) \cdot p_{V/W}(t).`$
3. Show that $m_V \mid\left(m_W \cdot m_{V / W}\right)$.

    Proof

    Let $P(x) = m_W(x) \cdot m_{V/W}(x)$. We show that $P(\phi)$ annihilates every vector in $V$. For any $v \in V$, let $\bar{\phi}$ be the operator induced on $V/W$. Since $m_{V/W}(\bar{\phi})=0$, we have that $w' = m_{V/W}(\phi)(v) \in W$. Then, since $m_W$ is the minimal polynomial for the restriction $\phi|_W$, we have $m_W(\phi)(w')=0$. Therefore,

   $P(\phi)(v) = m_W(\phi)(m_{V/W}(\phi)(v)) = m_W(\phi)(w') = 0$.

   Since $P(x)$ annihilates $\phi$, the minimal polynomial $m_V$ must divide $P(x)$.
# 3.
Fix a group $G$, and let $\mathrm{Sub}(G)$ be the category of subgroups of $G$, defined as follows:
- Its object are subgroups $H ⊂ G$;
- The only morphisms are identity maps $H_1 → H_2$ (which means that morphisms from $H_1 ⊂ G$ to $H_2 ⊂ G$ exist if and only if $H_1 ⊂ H_2$).

Let $H_1, H_2 \subset G$ be two subgroups, considered as objects of $\mathrm{Sub}(G)$.
1. What is their product in the category $\mathrm{Sub}(G)$? Justify.

    Proof

    The product of two subgroups $H_1$ and $H_2$ in the category $\mathrm{Sub}(G)$ is their intersection $P = H_1 \cap H_2$. To justify this, we verify the universal property. The projections $p_1: P \to H_1$ and $p_2: P \to H_2$ are the inclusion maps, which exist since $P \subset H_1$ and $P \subset H_2$. For any subgroup $K$ with morphisms (inclusions) $f_1: K \to H_1$ and $f_2: K \to H_2$, we have $K \subset H_1$ and $K \subset H_2$, which implies $K \subset P$. This gives a unique morphism $u: K \to P$ (the inclusion). The composition $p_1 \circ u$ is the inclusion $K \subset H_1$, which is $f_1$. Similarly, $p_2 \circ u = f_2$. Thus, the universal property is satisfied.
2. What is their coproduct in the category $\mathrm{Sub}(G)$? Justify.

    Proof

    The coproduct of two subgroups $H_1$ and $H_2$ in the category $\mathrm{Sub}(G)$ is the subgroup generated by their union, $C = \langle H_1 \cup H_2 \rangle$. To justify this, we verify the universal property. The injections $i_1: H_1 \to C$ and $i_2: H_2 \to C$ are the inclusion maps, which exist since $H_1 \subset C$ and $H_2 \subset C$. For any subgroup $K$ with morphisms (inclusions) $f_1: H_1 \to K$ and $f_2: H_2 \to K$, we have $H_1 \subset K$ and $H_2 \subset K$, which implies $H_1 \cup H_2 \subset K$. Since $K$ is a subgroup, it must contain the subgroup generated by this union, so $C \subset K$. This gives a unique morphism $u: C \to K$ (the inclusion). The composition $u \circ i_1$ is the inclusion $H_1 \to K$, which is $f_1$. Similarly, $u \circ i_2 = f_2$. Thus, the universal property is satisfied.
# 4.
Let $V_1, V_2$ be finite-dimensional vector spaces over $\mathbb{C}$. Recall that linear operators from $V_1$ to $V_2$ form a vector space $\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathbb{C}}\left(V_1, V_2\right)$.
1. Let $W \subset \mathrm{Hom}_{\mathbb{C}}\left(V_1, V_2\right)$ be a subspace, $\dim(W)=2$. Show that there exists $\phi \in W$ such that $\phi \neq 0$ and $\phi$ is not bijective.

    Proof

    We consider two cases based on the dimensions of $V_1$ and $V_2$.

    **Case 1: $\dim(V_1) \neq \dim(V_2)$**
    A linear operator between vector spaces of different dimensions cannot be bijective. Since $\dim(W) = 2$, $W$ is not the zero subspace, so there exists a non-zero operator $\phi \in W$. This operator $\phi$ cannot be bijective.

    **Case 2: $\dim(V_1) = \dim(V_2) = n$**
    For an operator to be bijective, it must be invertible, which is equivalent to its determinant being non-zero. If $n=0$, then $V_1, V_2$ are zero-dimensional, and $\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathbb{C}}(V_1, V_2)$ is also zero-dimensional, which contradicts $\dim(W)=2$. Thus, $n \ge 1$.

    Let $`\{\phi_1, \phi_2\}`$ be a basis for $W$. Any operator $\phi \in W$ can be written as $\phi = a\phi_1 + b\phi_2$ for some scalars $(a,b) \in \mathbb{C}^2$. Let's consider the determinant of such an operator as a function of $a$ and $b$: $P(a,b) = \det(a\phi_1 + b\phi_2)$. This is a homogeneous polynomial in $a$ and $b$ of degree $n$.

    *   If $P(a,b)$ is the zero polynomial, it means every operator in $W$ has a determinant of 0. Since $W$ is 2-dimensional, we can pick any non-zero operator $\phi \in W$, and it will be non-bijective.
    *   If $P(a,b)$ is not the zero polynomial, then as a non-zero homogeneous polynomial in two variables over the algebraically closed field $\mathbb{C}$, it must have a non-trivial root. That is, there exists $`(a_0, b_0) \in \mathbb{C}^2 \setminus \{(0,0)\}`$ such that $P(a_0, b_0) = 0$. Let $\phi = a_0\phi_1 + b_0\phi_2$. Since $(a_0, b_0)$ is non-zero and $`\{\phi_1, \phi_2\}`$ is a basis, $\phi$ is a non-zero operator. Its determinant is $\det(\phi) = P(a_0, b_0) = 0$, so it is not bijective.

    In all cases, we have found a non-zero, non-bijective operator $\phi \in W$.
2. Show that the statement fails if we replace the field $\mathbb{C}$ with $\mathbb{R}$.

    Proof

    Consider the vector spaces $V_1 = V_2 = \mathbb{R}^2$ and the subspace $W \subset \mathrm{Hom}_{\mathbb{R}}(V_1, V_2)$ spanned by the operators $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ defined as follows:
    
    $`\phi_1 = \begin{pmatrix}0 & -1 \\ 1 & 0\end{pmatrix}, \quad \phi_2 = \begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1\end{pmatrix}.`$
    
    Any operator in $W$ can be expressed as $a\phi_1 + b\phi_2$ for some $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$. The determinant of such an operator is given by:
    
    $`\det(a\phi_1 + b\phi_2) = \det\begin{pmatrix}b & -a \\ a & b\end{pmatrix} = b^2 + a^2.`$
    
    Since $b^2 + a^2 > 0$ for all $(a,b) \neq (0,0)$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$, every non-zero operator in $W$ is bijective. Thus, there is no non-zero operator in $W$ that is not bijective, demonstrating that the statement fails over $\mathbb{R}$.
# 5.
Let $G$ be a group (finite or infinite) and $V$ its representation (over some field). Assume $\dim(V)<\infty$. Define subrepresentation $V^c$ to be the span (equivalently, the sum) of all irreducible subrepresentations of $V$.
1. Show that $V^c$ is completely reducible.

    Proof

    By definition, $V^c$ is the sum of all irreducible subrepresentations of $V$. Let $U_1, U_2, \ldots, U_k$ be the irreducible subrepresentations whose sum forms $V^c$. Since each $U_i$ is irreducible, it cannot be decomposed further into smaller invariant subspaces. 

    To show that $V^c$ is completely reducible, we need to demonstrate that it can be expressed as a direct sum of its irreducible subrepresentations. We can construct this direct sum iteratively from the irreducible subrepresentations that span $V^c$. This process yields a subset of them whose direct sum is $V^c$:

   $`V^c = U_{i_1} \oplus U_{i_2} \oplus \cdots \oplus U_{i_k}.`$

   Therefore, $V^c$ is completely reducible.
2. Show that if $W$ is any completely reducible representation of $G$ and $\phi: W \rightarrow V$ is a homomorphism, then $\phi(W) \subset V^c$.

    Proof

    Since $W$ is completely reducible, it can be expressed as a direct sum of irreducible subrepresentations:

   $`W = W_1 \oplus W_2 \oplus \cdots \oplus W_m,`$

   where each $W_i$ is an irreducible representation of $G$. 

   Consider the homomorphism $\phi: W \rightarrow V$. The image of each irreducible component $W_i$ under $\phi$ is either the zero subspace or an irreducible subrepresentation of $V$. This is because the image of an irreducible representation under a homomorphism is either trivial or irreducible.

   Therefore, we have:

   $`\phi(W) = \phi(W_1) + \phi(W_2) + \cdots + \phi(W_m).`$

   Each non-zero $\phi(W_i)$ is an irreducible subrepresentation of $V$, and thus lies within $V^c$. Hence, the entire image $\phi(W)$ is contained in the span of all irreducible subrepresentations of $V$, which is precisely $V^c$. 

   Thus, we conclude that $\phi(W) \subset V^c$.
# 6.
Let $p$ be a prime number. Denote by $G$ the group of matrices

$`\begin{pmatrix}
1 & b \\
0 & a
\end{pmatrix},`$

where $a, b \in(\mathbb{Z} / p \mathbb{Z})$ and $a$ is not zero modulo $p$.

Prove that any complex irreducible representation of $G$ is either one-dimensional or $p-1$ dimensional. (Hint: consider eigenvectors of the action of the matrix with $a=b=1$.)

Proof

Let $V$ be a complex irreducible representation of $G$. Let $N$ be the subgroup of matrices of the form $`n_b = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & b \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}`$ for $b \in \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$. $N$ is isomorphic to the additive group $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ and is a normal subgroup of $G$.

Since $N$ is an abelian group and $V$ is a finite-dimensional complex representation, there exists a non-zero vector $v \in V$ that is a simultaneous eigenvector for all operators representing elements of $N$. That is, for each $n_b \in N$, there is a scalar $`\chi(b) \in \mathbb{C}^*`$ such that $\rho(n_b)v = \chi(b)v$. The map $`\chi: \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{C}^*`$ is a character of $N$. Any such character is of the form $\chi(b) = \lambda^b$ for some $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}^*$ which must be a $p$-th root of unity.

We consider two cases for the character $\chi$.

**Case 1: $\chi$ is the trivial character.**
This means $\chi(b) = 1$ for all $b \in \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$. The subspace $V_0 = \{w \in V \mid \rho(n_b)w = w \text{ for all } b \in \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}\}$ is non-empty. This subspace is stable under the action of $G$. Since $N$ is normal, for any $g' \in G$ and $w \in V_0$, we have $\rho(n_b)(\rho(g')w) = \rho(g')\rho(g'^{-1}n_bg')w$. As $g'^{-1}n_bg' \in N$, $\rho(g'^{-1}n_bg')w = w$, so $\rho(n_b)(\rho(g')w) = \rho(g')w$. Thus $\rho(g')w \in V_0$.

Since $V$ is irreducible and $V_0$ is a non-zero subrepresentation, we must have $V_0 = V$. This means $N$ acts trivially on all of $V$. The representation then factors through the quotient group $G/N \cong (\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^*$. Since $G/N$ is abelian, any irreducible representation of it must be one-dimensional. Therefore, $\dim(V) = 1$.

**Case 2: $\chi$ is a non-trivial character.**
This means $\lambda = \chi(1)$ is a $p$-th root of unity other than 1. Let $v$ be an eigenvector corresponding to $\chi$. Let $H$ be the subgroup of matrices $`h_a = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & a \end{pmatrix}`$ for $a \in (\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^*$.

Consider the vectors $v_a = \rho(h_a)v$ for $a \in (\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^*$. Let's see how $N$ acts on them:

$\rho(n_b)v_a = \rho(n_b)\rho(h_a)v = \rho(h_a)\rho(h_a^{-1}n_bh_a)v$.

A calculation shows $h_a^{-1}n_bh_a = n_{ab}$. So,

$\rho(n_b)v_a = \rho(h_a)\rho(n_{ab})v = \rho(h_a)\chi(ab)v = \chi(ab)v_a$.

This means $v_a$ is an eigenvector for $N$ with character $\chi^a(b) = \chi(ab)$. Since $\chi$ is non-trivial, all characters $\chi^a$ for $a \in (\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^*$ are distinct and non-trivial. The $p-1$ vectors $v_a$ are eigenvectors for distinct characters of $N$, so they are linearly independent.

Let $W = \mathrm{span}\{v_a \mid a \in (\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^*\}$. The dimension of $W$ is $p-1$.

$W$ is stable under $H$ since $\rho(h_{a'})v_a = \rho(h_{a'a})v = v_{a'a} \in W$.

$W$ is stable under $N$ since each basis vector $v_a$ is an eigenvector for every operator in $\rho(N)$.

Since $G$ is generated by $N$ and $H$, $W$ is a subrepresentation of $V$. As $V$ is irreducible and $W$ is non-zero, we must have $V=W$. Therefore, $\dim(V) = p-1$.

In conclusion, any complex irreducible representation of $G$ is either one-dimensional or $(p-1)$-dimensional.

where $a, b \in(\mathbb{Z} / p \mathbb{Z})$ and $a$ is not zero modulo $p$.

Prove that any complex irreducible representation of $G$ is either one-dimensional or $p-1$ dimensional. (Hint: consider eigenvectors of the action of the matrix with $a=b=1$.)
