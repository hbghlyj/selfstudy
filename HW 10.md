1. True or false: For any $n \times n$ matrix, the $n$-th power of its minimal polynomial is divisible by the characteristic polynomial.

    True. Let $p(x)$ and $m(x)$ be the characteristic and minimal polynomials. Let $\lambda$ be an eigenvalue with algebraic multiplicity $a$ and multiplicity $b$ in $m(x)$. We know $1 \le b \le a$. For $p(x)$ to divide $(m(x))^n$, we need $a \le nb$ for all eigenvalues. Since the total dimension is $n$, $a \le n$. Also, since $b \ge 1$, $n \le nb$. Thus $a \le n \le nb$, and the statement is true.
2. Up to similarity, how many $5 \times 5$ matrices have minimal polynomial $x^3-x^2$?

    Consider the possible Jordan canonical forms that satisfy this minimal polynomial and the matrix dimension. Each distinct Jordan canonical form corresponds to a unique similarity class.
    The minimal polynomial $m(x) = x^3-x^2 = x^2(x-1)$ gives the following constraints:
    *   The eigenvalues are 0 and 1.
    *   The largest Jordan block for $\lambda=0$ must be of size 2.
    *   All Jordan blocks for $\lambda=1$ must be of size 1.

    Since the matrix is $5 \times 5$, the sum of the sizes of all Jordan blocks must be 5. Let $a_0$ be the algebraic multiplicity of $\lambda=0$ and $a_1$ be that of $\lambda=1$. We have $a_0+a_1=5$. The constraints require $a_0 \ge 2$ and $a_1 \ge 1$, so $`a_0 \in \{2, 3, 4\}`$.

    The possible partitions of block sizes are:
    | $a_0$ | Partitions for $\lambda=0$ | $a_1$ | Partitions for $\lambda=1$ |
    |:-----:|:--------------------------:|:-----:|:--------------------------:|
    | 2     | (2)                        | 3     | (1, 1, 1)                  |
    | 3     | (2, 1)                     | 2     | (1, 1)                     |
    | 4     | (2, 2)                     | 1     | (1)                        |
    | 4     | (2, 1, 1)                  | 1     | (1)                        |

    This gives a total of 4 distinct similarity classes.
4. Give an example of a vector space $V \neq 0$ over $\mathbb{C}$ and an operator $\phi: V \rightarrow V$ such that $\phi$ does not have any eigenvalues.

   Let $V = \mathbb{C}[x]$ be the vector space of polynomials with complex coefficients. Define the operator $\phi: V \rightarrow V$ by $\phi(p(x)) = x \cdot p(x)$.

   If $\phi(p) = \lambda p$ for some $p \neq 0$ and $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}$, then $x p(x) = \lambda p(x)$. Comparing degrees, we get $\deg(p) + 1 = \deg(p)$, which is impossible. Thus, $\phi$ has no eigenvalues.
5. Give an example of a group $G$ and a representation of $G$ that is not completely reducible.

    The representation $ρ:\mathbb{Z}→GL_2(\mathbb C)$ where $`ρ(1)=\begin{pmatrix}1&1\\0&1\end{pmatrix}`$ is not completely reducible. Another example is $\mathbb{Z}_2$'s regular representation when the field's characteristic is 2.

6. True or false: If $V$ is a real representation of a finite group $G$, then any quotient representation $V / W$ (for an invariant subspace $W$) is isomorphic to a subrepresentation of $V$.

   True. Since $G$ is finite and the representation is over $\mathbb{R}$ (a field of characteristic 0), we can average over the group to construct a $G$-invariant complement to $W$. This requires dividing by $|G|$, which is valid in $\mathbb{R}$. This complement is isomorphic to the quotient $V/W$, which is therefore isomorphic to a subrepresentation of $V$.

Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional vector space (over some field) and $\phi: V \rightarrow V$ an operator. Suppose $W \subset V$ is an invariant subspace, so we can consider $\phi$ as an operator on three spaces: $V, W$, and $V / W$. Denote their minimal polynomials by $m_V, m_W$, and $m_{V / W}$, and their characteristic polynomials by $p_V, p_W$, and $p_{V / W}$ respectively.
1. Show that $p_V=p_W \cdot p_{V / W}$;
    
    Proof
    
    By definition, the characteristic polynomial of an operator is independent of the choice of basis. Since $W$ is an invariant subspace, we can choose a basis for $V$ that extends a basis for $W$. With respect to such a basis, the matrix of $\phi$ (let's call it $A$) has the block upper-triangular form:
    
    $`A = \begin{pmatrix}A_W & * \\ 0 & A_{V/W} \end{pmatrix}`$
    
    where $A_W$ is the matrix of the restriction of $\phi$ to $W$, and $A_{V/W}$ is the matrix of the induced operator on $V/W$.
    
    The characteristic polynomial of $\phi$ is then computed using this matrix:
   
    $`p_V(t) = \det(tI - A) = \det\begin{pmatrix}tI_W - A_W & -* \\ 0 & tI_{V/W} - A_{V/W}\end{pmatrix} = \det(tI_W - A_W) \cdot \det(tI_{V/W} - A_{V/W}) = p_W(t) \cdot p_{V/W}(t).`$
3. Show that $m_V \mid\left(m_W \cdot m_{V / W}\right)$.

    Proof

    Let $P(x) = m_W(x) \cdot m_{V/W}(x)$. We show that $P(\phi)$ annihilates every vector in $V$. For any $v \in V$, let $\bar{\phi}$ be the operator induced on $V/W$. Since $m_{V/W}(\bar{\phi})=0$, we have that $w' = m_{V/W}(\phi)(v) \in W$. Then, since $m_W$ is the minimal polynomial for the restriction $\phi|_W$, we have $m_W(\phi)(w')=0$. Therefore,

   $P(\phi)(v) = m_W(\phi)(m_{V/W}(\phi)(v)) = m_W(\phi)(w') = 0$.

   Since $P(x)$ annihilates $\phi$, the minimal polynomial $m_V$ must divide $P(x)$.
# 3.
Fix a group $G$, and let $\mathrm{Sub}(G)$ be the category of subgroups of $G$, defined as follows:
- Its object are subgroups $H ⊂ G$;
- The only morphisms are identity maps $H_1 → H_2$ (which means that morphisms from $H_1 ⊂ G$ to $H_2 ⊂ G$ exist if and only if $H_1 ⊂ H_2$).

Let $H_1, H_2 \subset G$ be two subgroups, considered as objects of $\mathrm{Sub}(G)$.
1. What is their product in the category $\mathrm{Sub}(G)$? Justify.

    Proof

    The product of two subgroups $H_1$ and $H_2$ in the category $\mathrm{Sub}(G)$ is their intersection $P = H_1 \cap H_2$. To justify this, we verify the universal property. The projections $p_1: P \to H_1$ and $p_2: P \to H_2$ are the inclusion maps, which exist since $P \subset H_1$ and $P \subset H_2$. For any subgroup $K$ with morphisms (inclusions) $f_1: K \to H_1$ and $f_2: K \to H_2$, we have $K \subset H_1$ and $K \subset H_2$, which implies $K \subset P$. This gives a unique morphism $u: K \to P$ (the inclusion). The composition $p_1 \circ u$ is the inclusion $K \subset H_1$, which is $f_1$. Similarly, $p_2 \circ u = f_2$. Thus, the universal property is satisfied.
2. What is their coproduct in the category $\mathrm{Sub}(G)$? Justify.

    Proof

    The coproduct of two subgroups $H_1$ and $H_2$ in the category $\mathrm{Sub}(G)$ is the subgroup generated by their union, $C = \langle H_1 \cup H_2 \rangle$. To justify this, we verify the universal property. The injections $i_1: H_1 \to C$ and $i_2: H_2 \to C$ are the inclusion maps, which exist since $H_1 \subset C$ and $H_2 \subset C$. For any subgroup $K$ with morphisms (inclusions) $f_1: H_1 \to K$ and $f_2: H_2 \to K$, we have $H_1 \subset K$ and $H_2 \subset K$, which implies $H_1 \cup H_2 \subset K$. Since $K$ is a subgroup, it must contain the subgroup generated by this union, so $C \subset K$. This gives a unique morphism $u: C \to K$ (the inclusion). The composition $u \circ i_1$ is the inclusion $H_1 \to K$, which is $f_1$. Similarly, $u \circ i_2 = f_2$. Thus, the universal property is satisfied.
# 4.
Let $V_1, V_2$ be finite-dimensional vector spaces over $\mathbb{C}$. Recall that linear operators from $V_1$ to $V_2$ form a vector space $\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathbb{C}}\left(V_1, V_2\right)$.
1. Let $W \subset \mathrm{Hom}_{\mathbb{C}}\left(V_1, V_2\right)$ be a subspace, $\dim(W)=2$. Show that there exists $\phi \in W$ such that $\phi \neq 0$ and $\phi$ is not bijective.

    Proof

    Since $\dim(W) = 2$, we can choose a basis $\{\phi_1, \phi_2\}$ for $W$. Consider the determinant function $\det: W \to \mathbb{C}$ defined by $\det(a\phi_1 + b\phi_2)$ for $(a,b) \in \mathbb{C}^2$. This is a homogeneous polynomial of degree equal to the dimension of $V_1$ (assuming $\dim(V_1) = \dim(V_2)$ for bijectivity). Since it is a non-constant polynomial, it must have a root in $\mathbb{C}^2$. Thus, there exist scalars $a, b$, not both zero, such that $\det(a\phi_1 + b\phi_2) = 0$. Therefore, the operator $\phi = a\phi_1 + b\phi_2$ is non-zero and not bijective.
2. Show that the statement fails if we replace the field $\mathbb{C}$ with $\mathbb{R}$.
# 5.
Let $G$ be a group (finite or infinite) and $V$ its representation (over some field). Assume $\dim(V)<\infty$. Define subrepresentation $V^c$ to be the span (equivalently, the sum) of all irreducible subrepresentations of $V$.
1. Show that $V^c$ is completely reducible.
2. Show that if $W$ is any completely reducible representation of $G$ and $\phi: W \rightarrow V$ is a homomorphism, then $\phi(W) \subset V^c$.
# 6.
Let $p$ be a prime number. Denote by $G$ the group of matrices

$`\begin{pmatrix}
1 & b \\
0 & a
\end{pmatrix},`$

where $a, b \in(\mathbb{Z} / p \mathbb{Z})$ and $a$ is not zero modulo $p$.

Prove that any complex irreducible representation of $G$ is either one-dimensional or $p-1$ dimensional. (Hint: consider eigenvectors of the action of the matrix with $a=b=1$.)
