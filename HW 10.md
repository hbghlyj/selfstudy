Let $M$ be a smooth manifold with or without boundary, and let $\omega \in \Omega^p(M)$, $\eta \in \Omega^q(M)$ be closed forms. Show that the de Rham cohomology class of $\omega \wedge \eta$ depends only on the cohomology classes of $\omega$ and $\eta$, and thus there is a well-defined bilinear map

$\cup: H_{\mathrm{dR}}^p(M) \times H_{\mathrm{dR}}^q(M) \longrightarrow H_{\mathrm{dR}}^{p+q}(M),$

called the cup product, given by

$[\omega] \smile[\eta]=[\omega \wedge \eta].$

Proof. Let $\omega \in \Omega^p(M)$ and $\eta \in \Omega^q(M)$ be closed forms. We must show that the cohomology class $[\omega \wedge \eta]$ depends only on the cohomology classes $[\omega]$ and $[\eta]$.
Suppose first that $\omega$ is replaced by a cohomologous form $\omega'=\omega+d \alpha$, where $\alpha \in \Omega^{p-1}(M)$.
Then

$\omega' \wedge \eta=(\omega+d \alpha) \wedge \eta=\omega \wedge \eta+d \alpha \wedge \eta .$

Since $\eta$ is closed, $d \eta=0$, we compute

$d(\alpha \wedge \eta)=d \alpha \wedge \eta+(-1)^{p-1} \alpha \wedge d \eta=d \alpha \wedge \eta .$

Thus

$\omega' \wedge \eta=\omega \wedge \eta+d(\alpha \wedge \eta),$

so $\omega' \wedge \eta$ and $\omega \wedge \eta$ differ by an exact form. Hence

$\left[\omega' \wedge \eta\right]=[\omega \wedge \eta] .$

Similarly if $\eta$ is replaced by a cohomologous form $\eta'=\eta+d \beta$, with $\beta \in \Omega^{q-1}(M)$. Then

$\omega \wedge \eta'=\omega \wedge(\eta+d \beta)=\omega \wedge \eta+\omega \wedge d \beta .$

Because $\omega$ is closed, $d \omega=0$, we have

$d(\omega \wedge \beta)=d \omega \wedge \beta+(-1)^p \omega \wedge d \beta=(-1)^p \omega \wedge d \beta .$

Hence

$\omega \wedge d \beta=(-1)^p d(\omega \wedge \beta),$

which is exact, and thus

$\left[\omega \wedge \eta'\right]=[\omega \wedge \eta] .$

We have shown that replacing either $\omega$ or $\eta$ by a cohomologous form does not change the cohomology class of $\omega \wedge \eta$. Therefore the assignment

$([\omega],[\eta]) \longmapsto[\omega \wedge \eta]$

is well defined on de Rham cohomology.

Let $M$ be a smooth manifold. Show that the total spaces of $T M$ and $T^* M$ are orientable.

Proof. We will show that the standard coordinate charts form an oriented atlas. Choose a coordinate chart $\left(U, x^1, \ldots, x^n\right)$ on $M$. This induces a local trivialization

$\left.T M\right|_U \cong U \times \mathbb{R}^n,$

given by expressing a tangent vector in the coordinate basis $`\left\{\partial / \partial x^1, \ldots, \partial / \partial x^n\right\}`$. Let $\left(v^1, \ldots, v^n\right)$ denote the fiber coordinates in this basis.
Thus we obtain coordinates

$\left(x^1, \ldots, x^n, v^1, \ldots, v^n\right)$

on $\left.T M\right|_U$.
On the overlap of two coordinate charts $U$ and $V$ with coordinate functions $x^i$ and $y^j$, the coordinate change on $T M$ is given by

$\left(x^i, v^i\right) \mapsto\left(y^j(x), \tilde{v}^j\right), \text{ where } \tilde{v}^j = \sum_i v^i \frac{\partial y^j}{\partial x^i}(x).$

In matrix form, the Jacobian of this transformation is block triangular:

$`J=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
\frac{\partial y^j}{\partial x^i} & 0 \\
* & \frac{\partial y^j}{\partial x^i}
\end{array}\right) .`$

Therefore,

$\det(J)=\det\left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}\right) \det\left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}\right)=\left(\det\left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}\right)\right)^2>0 .$

Hence the transition map between coordinate charts on $T M$ always has positive Jacobian determinant.

This shows that the coordinate atlas on $T M$ is orientation-compatible across overlaps, so $T M$ is orientable.

The argument for $T^* M$ is similar: its fiber coordinates transform via the inverse transpose of the base Jacobian. The determinant of the full transition map on $T^*M$ is thus $\det(\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}) \det((\frac{\partial y}{\partial x})^{-1}) = 1 > 0$.

Let $M, N$ be smooth manifolds, and suppose $\pi: M \rightarrow N$ is a surjective smooth submersion with connected fibers. We say that a tangent vector $v \in T_p M$ is vertical if $d \pi_p(v)=0$. Suppose $\omega \in \Omega^k(M)$. Show that there exists $\eta \in \Omega^k(N)$ such that $\omega=\pi^* \eta$ if and only if $v\lrcorner \omega_p=0$ and $\left.v\right\lrcorner d \omega_p=0$ for every $p \in M$ and every vertical vector $v \in T_p M$.
Hint: first do the case in which $\pi: \mathbb{R}^{n+m} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ is projection onto the first $n$ coordinates.
Proof. Suppose there exists such a form. Then

$`\begin{aligned}
v\lrcorner \omega_p & =v\lrcorner \eta_{\pi(p)}\left(\pi_*(\cdot), \ldots, \pi_*(\cdot)\right) \\
& =\eta_{\pi(p)}\left(\pi_*(v), \pi_*(\cdot), \ldots, \pi_*(\cdot)\right) \\
& =\eta_{\pi(p)}\left(0, \pi_*(\cdot), \ldots, \pi_*(\cdot)\right) \\
& =0 .
\end{aligned}`$

Since the exterior derivative commutes with pullback,

$v\lrcorner d \omega=v\lrcorner \pi^* d \eta,$

which thus vanishes by the same preceding computation.
Conversely, suppose the two conditions hold. The connected fibers hypothesis implies that either $\pi$ is a diffeomorphism, in which we can just set $\eta=\left(\pi^{-1}\right)^* \omega$, or $\operatorname{dim}(M)= n+m>n=\operatorname{dim}(N)$. First note that for any point $p \in M$, if such an $\eta_{\pi(p)}$ exists, it must be unique, since otherwise we would have

$0=\left(\pi^* \eta_1\right)_p-\left(\pi^* \eta_2\right)_p=\left(\pi^*\left(\eta_1-\eta_2\right)\right)_p$

which implies $\eta_1-\eta_2=0$ at $\pi(p)$ since $d \pi$ is surjective and hence so is $\wedge^k d \pi$. Now given $q \in N$, choose $p \in \pi^{-1}(q)$ and coordinates about $p, q$ such that $\pi$ takes the form of projection $\mathbb{R}^{n+m} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ onto the first $n$ components. Then $\partial_{n+1}, \ldots, \partial_{n+m}$ form a frame for the vertical vectors. Write

$\omega=\sum_{1 \leq i_1<\cdots<i_k \leq n+m} f_{i_1 \ldots i_k}\left(x^1, \ldots, x^{n+m}\right) d x^{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge d x^{i_k} .$

By hypothesis $\left.\partial_i\right\lrcorner \omega=0$ and $\left.\partial_i\right\lrcorner d \omega=0$ for $n+1 \leq i \leq n+m$. Therefore, $f_{i_1 \ldots i_k} \equiv 0$ if $n+1 \leq i_j \leq n+m$, and $\partial_l f_{i_1 \ldots i_k} \equiv 0$ if $n+1 \leq l \leq n+m$. Thus if we set

$\eta=\sum_{1 \leq i_1<\cdots<i_k \leq n} f_{i_1 \ldots i_k}\left(x^1, \ldots, x^n, 0, \ldots, 0\right) d x^{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge d x^{i_k},$

$\eta$ descends to a $k$-form on the coordinate chart about $q$ and satisfies $\pi^* \eta=\omega$.
To see that $\eta$ is well-defined, let $q \in N$ and let $p_1, p_2$ be distinct points in the fiber over $q$. Connect $p_1, p_2$ with some smooth curve $\gamma:[0,1] \rightarrow M$, and suppose we have defined $\eta$ in a neighborhood $V \ni q$ using $\omega$ in a neighborhood $U_1 \ni p_1$ as above. Cover the image of $\gamma$ by finitely many open balls $U_1, \ldots, U_N$ such that $U_i$ intersects $U_{i+1}$ for $1 \leq i \leq N-1$,

and such that there exist submersion-adapted charts on $U_i, V$ for $1 \leq i \leq N$. By the aforementioned uniqueness property and the nontrivial overlap between $U_i$ and $U_{i+1}$, we have that $\eta$ as defined via $U_i$ or $U_{i+1}$ must agree near $q$, so the definition of $\eta$ near $q$ is independent of choice of $U_1$ or $U_N$.
Once we have that $\eta$ is well-defined, smoothness of $\eta$ follows from its definition with respect to some pair of submersion-adapted charts.

Let $S \subset M$ be a submanifold. A smooth retraction from $M$ to $S$ is a smooth map $f: M \rightarrow S$ such that $\left.f\right|_S=I d_S$. Let $M$ be a compact, oriented manifold with boundary. Show that there does not exist a smooth retraction $r: M \rightarrow \partial M$.

Proof. (Waldron's notes Corollary 46.5) Suppose for contradiction that there exists a smooth retraction $r$. Let $\omega$ be any positively oriented ( $n-1$ )-form on $\partial M$ (with the Stokes orientation). We have

$0<\int_{\partial M} \omega=\int_{\partial M} i^*(r^* \omega)$

since $`\left.r\right|_{\partial M}=\mathrm{Id}_{\partial M}`$ (where $i: \partial M \hookrightarrow M$ is the inclusion). Note that $r^* \omega$ is a globally defined form on $M$, which has compact support since $M$ is compact. Stokes's Theorem gives

$0<\int_{\partial M} i^*(r^* \omega)=\int_M d\left(r^* \omega\right)=\int_M r^*(d \omega)$

But at the last step, $d$ is the exterior derivative on $\partial M$, which has dimension $n-1$, so that $d \omega=0$. We have proven $0<0$, a contradiction.
