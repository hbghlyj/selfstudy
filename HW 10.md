1. True or false: For any $n \times n$ matrix, the $n$-th power of its minimal polynomial is divisible by the characteristic polynomial.

    True. Let $p(x)$ and $m(x)$ be the characteristic and minimal polynomials. Let $\lambda$ be an eigenvalue with algebraic multiplicity $a$ and multiplicity $b$ in $m(x)$. We know $1 \le b \le a$. For $p(x)$ to divide $(m(x))^n$, we need $a \le nb$ for all eigenvalues. Since the total dimension is $n$, $a \le n$. Also, since $b \ge 1$, $n \le nb$. Thus $a \le n \le nb$, and the statement is true.
2. Up to similarity, how many $5 \times 5$ matrices have minimal polynomial $x^3-x^2$?

    Consider the possible Jordan canonical forms that satisfy this minimal polynomial and the matrix dimension. Each distinct Jordan canonical form corresponds to a unique similarity class.
    The minimal polynomial $m(x) = x^3-x^2 = x^2(x-1)$ gives the following constraints:
    *   The eigenvalues are 0 and 1.
    *   The largest Jordan block for $\lambda=0$ must be of size 2.
    *   All Jordan blocks for $\lambda=1$ must be of size 1.

    Since the matrix is $5 \times 5$, the sum of the sizes of all Jordan blocks must be 5. Let $a_0$ be the algebraic multiplicity of $\lambda=0$ and $a_1$ be that of $\lambda=1$. We have $a_0+a_1=5$. The constraints require $a_0 \ge 2$ and $a_1 \ge 1$, so $`a_0 \in \{2, 3, 4\}`$.

    The possible partitions of block sizes are:
    | $a_0$ | Partitions for $\lambda=0$ | $a_1$ | Partitions for $\lambda=1$ |
    |:-----:|:--------------------------:|:-----:|:--------------------------:|
    | 2     | (2)                        | 3     | (1, 1, 1)                  |
    | 3     | (2, 1)                     | 2     | (1, 1)                     |
    | 4     | (2, 2)                     | 1     | (1)                        |
    | 4     | (2, 1, 1)                  | 1     | (1)                        |

    This gives a total of 4 distinct similarity classes.
4. Give an example of a vector space $V \neq 0$ over $\mathbb{C}$ and an operator $\phi: V \rightarrow V$ such that $\phi$ does not have any eigenvalues.
  Let $V = \mathbb{C}[x]$ be the vector space of polynomials with complex coefficients. Define the operator $\phi: V \rightarrow V$ by $\phi(p(x)) = x \cdot p(x)$.
  If $\phi(p) = \lambda p$ for some $p \neq 0$ and $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}$, then $x p(x) = \lambda p(x)$. Comparing degrees, we get $\deg(p) + 1 = \deg(p)$, which is impossible. Thus, $\phi$ has no eigenvalues.
5. Give an example of a group $G$ and a representation of $G$ that is not completely reducible.
6. True or false: If $V$ is a real representation of a finite group $G$, then any quotient representation $V / W$ (for an invariant subspace $W$ ) is isomorphic to a subrepresentation of $V$.
# 2.
Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional vector space (over some field) and $\phi: V \rightarrow V$ an operator. Suppose $W \subset V$ is an invariant subspace, so we can consider $\phi$ as an operator on three spaces: $V, W$, and $V / W$. Denote their minimal polynomials by $m_V, m_W$, and $m_{V / W}$, and their characteristic polynomials by $p_V, p_W$, and $p_{V / W}$ respectively.
1. Show that $p_V=p_W \cdot p_{V / W}$;
2. Show that $m_V \mid\left(m_W \cdot m_{V / W}\right)$.
# 3.
Fix a group $G$, and let $\mathrm{Sub}(G)$ be the category of subgroups of $G$, defined as follows:
- Its object are subgroups $H ⊂ G$;
- The only morphisms are identity maps $H_1 → H_2$ (which means that morphisms from $H_1 ⊂ G$ to $H_2 ⊂ G$ exist if and only if $H_1 ⊂ H_2$).

Let $H_1, H_2 \subset G$ be two subgroups, considered as objects of $\mathrm{Sub}(G)$.
1. What is their product in the category $\mathrm{Sub}(G)$ ? Justify.
2. What is their coproduct in the category $\mathrm{Sub}(G)$ ? Justify.
# 4.
Let $V_1, V_2$ be finite-dimensional vector spaces over $\mathbb{C}$. Recall that linear operators from $V_1$ to $V_2$ form a vector space $\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathbb{C}}\left(V_1, V_2\right)$.
1. Let $W \subset \mathrm{Hom}_{\mathbb{C}}\left(V_1, V_2\right)$ be a subspace, $\mathrm{dim}(W)=2$. Show that there exists $\phi \in W$ such that $\phi \neq 0$ and $\phi$ is not bijective.
2. Show that the statement fails if we replace the field $\mathbb{C}$ with $\mathbb{R}$.
# 5.
Let $G$ be a group (finite or infinite) and $V$ its representation (over some field). Assume $\dim(V)<\infty$. Define subrepresentation $V^c$ to be the span (equivalently, the sum) of all irreducible subrepresentations of $V$.
1. Show that $V^c$ is completely reducible.
2. Show that if $W$ is any completely reducible representation of $G$ and $\phi: W \rightarrow V$ is a homomorphism, then $\phi(W) \subset V^c$.
# 6.
Let $p$ be a prime number. Denote by $G$ the group of matrices

$\begin{pmatrix}
1 & b \\
0 & a
\end{pmatrix},$

where $a, b \in(\mathbb{Z} / p \mathbb{Z})$ and $a$ is not zero modulo $p$. (This group already appeared on the midterm.)

Prove that any complex irreducible representation of $G$ is either one-dimensional or $p-1$ dimensional. (Hint: consider eigenvectors of the action of the matrix with $a=b=1$.)
