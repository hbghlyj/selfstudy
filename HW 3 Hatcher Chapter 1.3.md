Let $p: \tilde{X} \to X$ be a covering space with $p^{-1}(x)$ finite and nonempty for all $x \in X$.

Show that $\tilde{X}$ is compact Hausdorff iff $X$ is compact Hausdorff.

Construct a simply-connected covering space of the space $X \subset \mathbb{R}^3$ that is the union of a sphere and a diameter.

Do the same when $X$ is the union of a sphere and a circle intersecting it in two points.

Solution

Consider $\tilde{X}$ which consists of infinitely many copies of $S^2$, stacked vertically in a line, with the south pole of one connected to the north pole of the previous.

The covering projection $p: \tilde{X} \to X$ can be defined by mapping each sphere $S_n$ in $\tilde{X}$ to the sphere in $X$ with an alternating orientation. For spheres $S_n$ with even $n$, the map is orientation-preserving, sending the north and south poles of $S_n$ to the north and south poles of $X$, respectively. For spheres $S_n$ with odd $n$, the map is orientation-reversing, sending the north pole of $S_n$ to the south pole of $X$ and the south pole of $S_n$ to the north pole of $X$. This ensures the map is well-defined on the identified poles.

To see that $p$ is a covering map, note that for any point $x$ in $S^2$ that is not the north or south pole, there exists an open neighborhood $U$ of $x$ in $S^2$ such that $p^{-1}(U)$ is a disjoint union of open sets in $\tilde{X}$, each of which is homeomorphic to $U$. For the north and south poles, we can take small neighborhoods around them that do not include the other pole of $S^2$, and similarly, their preimages in $\tilde{X}$ will be a segment and a sphere cap homeomorphic to these neighborhoods. Thus, $p$ satisfies the definition of a covering map.

Let $\tilde{X}$ and $\tilde{Y}$ be simply-connected covering spaces of the path-connected, locally path-connected spaces $X$ and $Y$.

Show that if $X \simeq Y$ then $\tilde{X} \simeq \tilde{Y}$. [Exercise 11 in Chapter 0 may be helpful.]

Let $a$ and $b$ be the generators of $\pi_1(S^1 \vee S^1)$ corresponding to the two $S^1$ summands.

Draw a picture of the covering space of $S^1 \vee S^1$ corresponding to the normal subgroup generated by $a^2, b^2$, and $(a b)^4$, and prove that this covering space is indeed the correct one.

# 17
Given a group $G$ and a normal subgroup $N$, show that there exists a normal covering space $\tilde{X} \to X$ with $\pi_1(X) \cong G, \pi_1(\tilde{X}) \cong N$, and deck transformation group $G(\tilde{X}) \cong G / N$.

# 18
For a path-connected, locally path-connected, and semilocally simply-connected space $X$, call a path-connected covering space $\tilde{X} \to X$ abelian if it is normal and has abelian deck transformation group.

Show that $X$ has an abelian covering space that is a covering space of every other abelian covering space of $X$, and that such a 'universal' abelian covering space is unique up to isomorphism. Describe this covering space explicitly for $X=S^1 \vee S^1$ and $X=S^1 \vee S^1 \vee S^1$.

# 19
Use the preceding problem to show that a closed orientable surface $M_g$ of genus $g$ has a connected normal covering space with deck transformation group isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}^n$ (the product of $n$ copies of $\mathbb{Z}$) iff $n \leq 2 g$.

For $n=3$ and $g \geq 3$, describe such a covering space explicitly as a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^3$ with translations of $\mathbb{R}^3$ as deck transformations.

Show that such a covering space in $\mathbb{R}^3$ exists iff there is an embedding of $M_g$ in the 3-torus $T^3=S^1 \times S^1 \times S^1$ such that the induced map $\pi_1\left(M_g\right) \to \pi_1\left(T^3\right)$ is surjective.

# 23
Show that if a group $G$ acts freely and properly discontinuously on a Hausdorff space $X$, then the action is a covering space action. (Here 'properly discontinuously' means that each $x \in X$ has a neighborhood $U$ such that $\{g \in G \mid U \cap g(U) \neq \varnothing\}$ is finite.)

In particular, a free action of a finite group on a Hausdorff space is a covering space action.

# 27
For a universal cover $p: \tilde{X} \to X$ there are two actions of $\pi_1\left(X, x_0\right)$ on the fiber $p^{-1}\left(x_0\right)$. The first is the action defined on page 69 in which the element of $\pi_1\left(X, x_0\right)$ determined by a loop $\gamma$ sends $\tilde{\gamma}(1)$ to $\tilde{\gamma}(0)$ for each lift $\tilde{\gamma}$ of $\gamma$ to $\tilde{X}$, and the second is the action given by restricting deck transformations to the fiber (see Proposition 1.39). Show that these two actions are different when $X=S^1 \vee S^1$ and when $X=S^1 \times S^1$ and determine when the two actions are the same. [This is a revised version of the original form of this exercise.]
