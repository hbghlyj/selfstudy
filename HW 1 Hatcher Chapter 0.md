# Exercise 1
Construct an explicit deformation retraction of the torus with one point deleted
onto a graph consisting of two circles intersecting in a point, namely, longitude and
meridian circles of the torus.

Define a map $F_t$ from the torus with one point deleted to the boundary of the square (two circles intersecting at a point) as follows:

Draw a ray from the deleted point to each point $x$, intersecting the boundary of the square at $y$.

Define $F_t(x)=(1-t)x+ty$.

This map is continuous because every coordinate component is continuous.

If $x$ is on the boundary of the square, then $y=x$, so $F_t(x)=x$.

# Exercise 2

Construct an explicit deformation retraction of $`\mathbb{R}^n-\{0\}`$ onto $S^{n-1}$.

Solution

Define a map

$`\begin{aligned}
F_t: \mathbb{R}^n-\{0\} & \to S^{n-1} \\
\left(x_1, \cdots, x_n\right) & \mapsto (1-t)\left(x_1, \cdots, x_n\right)+\frac{t}{\sqrt{x_1^2+\cdots+x_n^2}}\left(x_1, \cdots, x_n\right)
\end{aligned}`$

It is continuous because every coordinate component is continuous.
*	$F_0(x) = x$ for all $`x ∈ \mathbb{R}^n-\{0\}`$
*	$F_1(x) ∈ S^{n-1}$ for all $`x ∈ \mathbb{R}^n-\{0\}`$
*	$F_t(a) = a$ for all $a ∈ S^{n-1}$ and $t ∈ [0, 1]$

therefore the map is a deformation retraction.
