1. Prove that the MÃ¶bius strip
$M=[0,1] \times\left(-\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}\right) /(0, y) \sim(1,-y)$
is a topological manifold.

2. Prove that $\mathbb{RP}^2$ is Hausdorff, second-countable, and compact.

3. Prove that $\mathbb{RP}^2$ is homeomorphic to the closed 2-disk with opposite boundary points identified:
$\mathbb{RP}^2 \cong \overline{\mathbb{D}}^2 /(\cos \theta, \sin \theta) \sim(\cos (\theta+\pi), \sin (\theta+\pi)) .$
