# 1.
Show that $\mathscr{O}_{\mathbb{RP}^1}(-1)$ is isomorphic to the Möbius bundle.

# 2.
State and prove a universal property that characterizes the tensor-product bundle $E \otimes F$ up to canonical isomorphism.

Statement:

For vector bundles $E$ and $F$ over a topological space $X$, the tensor-product bundle $E \otimes F$ is a vector bundle over $X$ together with a bilinear map of bundles

$\varphi: E \times_X F \to E \otimes F$

such that for any vector bundle $G$ over $X$ and any bilinear map of bundles $\psi: E \times_X F \to G$, there exists a unique bundle morphism $\tilde{\psi}: E \otimes F \to G$ such that

$\psi = \tilde{\psi} \circ \varphi.$

Proof:

# 3.
Prove that for any line bundle, $L \otimes L^*$ is trivial.

# 4.
Show that for a smooth submanifold $S \subset M$, the tangent bundle $T S \subset T M|_S$ is a subbundle.

# 5.
Let $E \rightarrow X$ and $F \rightarrow X$ be vector bundles of rank $r$ over the same space. Then $E$ and $F$ are isomorphic if and only if, after passing to a common refinement $`\{U_a\}_{a \in \mathcal{I}}`$, their respective transition functions $\sigma_{a b}$ and $\sigma_{a b}'$ are related by

$\sigma_{a b}=\tau_b^{-1} \sigma_{a b}' \tau_a$

for a collection of matrix-valued functions $`\{\tau_a \in C^0\left(U_a, \mathrm{GL}(r, K)\right)\}_{a \in \mathcal{I}}`$.

# 6.
Exhibit an isomorphism between $T \mathbb{C P}^1$ and $\mathscr{O}(n)$ for some $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ (please say which).
