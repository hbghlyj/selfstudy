In this problem, no explanation is required. All parts are worth 2 points.
1. True or false: In a free abelian group of finite rank, every linearly independent set can be completed to a basis?
   
2. How many different (up to isomorphism) abelian groups of order 300 are there?
   
3. True or false: For any action of a finite group $G$ on a finite set $X$, the cardinality $|X|$ divides $|G|$ ?
   
4. Give an example of an infinite group $G$ such that every element of $G$ has finite order.
   
5. Let $F_2$ be the free group on two generators. True or false: For every $n$, there exists a normal subgroup $H_n \subset F_2$ such that $F_2 / H_n \simeq S_n$?

Let $\mathbb{Q}^{\times}$ be the group of non-zero rational numbers under multiplication.
1. Show that $\mathbb{Q}^{\times}$is isomorphic to the product of $\mathbb{Z} / 2 \mathbb{Z}$ and a free abelian group.
2. Describe all group homomorphisms $\mathbb{Z} / 2 \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Q}^{\times}$.
3. Describe all group homomorphisms $\mathbb{Q}^{\times} \to \mathbb{Z} / 2 \mathbb{Z}$.

Let $G$ be a group of order $2017 \times 2027 \times 2029$ (these are all prime numbers). Show that $G$ is cyclic.
# 4
Let $G$ be a finite group, and let $A=\mathrm{Aut}(G)$ be the group of automorphisms $\phi: G \to G$. Consider the natural action of $A$ on $G$, and take the quotient $G / A$.
1. What is $|G / A|$ if $G=\mathbb{Z} / 6 \mathbb{Z}$.

2. Show that if $|G / A|=2$, then $G \simeq(\mathbb{Z} / p \mathbb{Z})^n$ for a prime $p$ and $n>0$.

# 5
A finite group $G$ acts transitively (that is, with a single orbit) on a finite set $X$ such that $|X|>1$. Show that there exists an element $g \in G$ which does not fix any element of $X$.

# 6
A map $\phi: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is said to be an affine-linear bijection if it is of the form

$\phi(x)=a x+b \quad(a, b \in \mathbb{R}: a \neq 0)$

1. Show that the set of affine-linear bijections forms a group $G$ under composition.
   
2. Show that $G$ is isomorphic to semidirect product of abelian groups $A$ and $B$. Make sure to identify the groups $A$ and $B$, as well as the action of one on the other used in the semidirect product.
