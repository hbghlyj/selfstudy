1. True or false: In a free abelian group of finite rank, every linearly independent set can be completed to a basis?

   False.

   The set {2} in $\mathbb{Z}$ is linearly independent, but it does not generate $\mathbb{Z}$ (e.g., 1 is not a multiple of 2). Any extension, like $\{2, n\}$ for an integer $n \neq 0$, is linearly dependent because of the non-trivial linear combination $n \cdot 2 - 2 \cdot n = 0$. Therefore, $\{2\}$ cannot be extended to a basis.

2. How many different (up to isomorphism) abelian groups of order 300 are there?

   Four.

   $300=2^2 \times 3 \times 5^2$
   
   The number of groups is $p(2) \times p(1) \times p(2) = 2 \times 1 \times 2 = 4$, where $p(n)$ is the number of partitions of $n$.
3. True or false: For any action of a finite group $G$ on a finite set $X$, the cardinality $|X|$ divides $|G|$?

   False. For any non-trivial group $G$, consider an action on $X = G \sqcup \{p\}$, where $G$ acts on itself by left multiplication and fixes the point $p$. Then $|X| = |G|+1$, which does not divide $|G|$.
   
4. Give an example of an infinite group $G$ such that every element of $G$ has finite order.

   The group $\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$ is infinite, and every element $[\frac{n}{m}]$ has finite order since $m \cdot [\frac{n}{m}] = [n] = [0]$.
5. Let $F_2$ be the free group on two generators. True or false: For every $n$, there exists a normal subgroup $H_n \subset F_2$ such that $F_2 / H_n \simeq S_n$?

    True.

   Since $S_n$ is generated by the cycles $(12)$ and $(123\dots n)$ for $n \ge 2$ (and the case $n=1$ is trivial), let $H_n$ be the kernel of a homomorphism $F_2 \to S_n$ that maps the generators to $(12)$ and $(123\dots n)$.
   So $H_n$ is a normal subgroup of $F_2$ such that $F_2 / H_n \simeq S_n$.

Let $\mathbb{Q}^{\times}$ be the group of non-zero rational numbers under multiplication.
1. Show that $\mathbb{Q}^{\times}$ is isomorphic to the product of $\mathbb{Z} / 2 \mathbb{Z}$ and a free abelian group.

  Proof
  
   Any non-zero rational number has a unique factorization $q = (\pm 1)\prod_{p\text{ prime}}p^{n_p}$, where $n_p \in \mathbb{Z}$ and only finitely many are non-zero, so
   
   $`\mathbb{Q}^{\times} \cong \mathbb{Z} / 2 \mathbb{Z} \times \bigoplus_{p\text{ prime}}\mathbb{Z}`$
   
   Here, $\mathbb{Z} / 2 \mathbb{Z}$ corresponds to $\pm1$, and each $\mathbb{Z}$ corresponds to the exponents of a prime $p$.

2. Describe all group homomorphisms $\mathbb{Z} / 2 \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Q}^{\times}$.

  Answer: The image of $1 \in \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ must have order dividing 2. The only elements in $\mathbb{Q}^{\times}$ of order $\le 2$ are $\pm 1$. This gives two homomorphisms: the trivial one, and the one mapping $1 \mapsto -1$.
3. Describe all group homomorphisms $\mathbb{Q}^{\times} \to \mathbb{Z} / 2 \mathbb{Z}$.

   Solution

   A homomorphism $f: \mathbb{Q}^{\times} \to \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ is determined by its values on the basis elements $`\{-1\}\cup P`$. The value of $f$ on each basis element can be chosen independently to be either 0 or 1 in $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$.

   The group of homomorphisms, $\text{Hom}(\mathbb{Q}^{\times}, \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})$, is therefore isomorphic to $`\prod_{i \in \{-1\} \cup P} \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}`$, where $P$ is the set of primes.

Let $G$ be a group of order $2017 \times 2027 \times 2029$ (these are all prime numbers). Show that $G$ is cyclic.

Let $G$ be a finite group, and let $A=\mathrm{Aut}(G)$ be the group of automorphisms $\phi: G \to G$. Consider the natural action of $A$ on $G$, and take the quotient $G / A$.
1. What is $|G / A|$ if $G=\mathbb{Z} / 6 \mathbb{Z}$.

Solution

$\phiâˆˆ A$ is determined by $\phi(1)$, which must be a generator of $G$. The generators of $\mathbb{Z}/6\mathbb{Z}$ are $1$ and $5$, so $|A| = 2$. The orbits under the action of $A$ on $G$ are $`\{0\}`$, $`\{1, 5\}`$, $\{2, 4\}`$, and $`\{3\}`$. Thus, there are 4 distinct orbits, giving $|G/A| = 4$.

2. Show that if $|G / A|=2$, then $G \simeq(\mathbb{Z} / p \mathbb{Z})^n$ for a prime $p$ and $n>0$.

# 5
A finite group $G$ acts transitively (that is, with a single orbit) on a finite set $X$ such that $|X|>1$. Show that there exists an element $g \in G$ which does not fix any element of $X$.

Proof

Assume for contradiction that every element of $G$ fixes at least one element of $X$.

This implies $G = \bigcup_{x \in X} G_x$, where $`G_x = \{g \in G \mid g \cdot x = x\}`$ is the stabilizer of $x$.

By the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem and transitivity, $|G_x| = |G|/|X|$ for all $x \in X$.

Since $|X| > 1$, each $G_x$ is a proper subgroup.

Using a counting argument, we can bound the size of the union.

Since the identity element $e$ is in every stabilizer, we have $|G| = |\bigcup_{x \in X} G_x| \le 1 + \sum_{x \in X} (|G_x| - 1) = 1 + |X|(\frac{|G|}{|X|} - 1) = 1 + |G| - |X|$.

This inequality simplifies to $|X| \le 1$, which contradicts the given condition that $|X| > 1$.

Therefore, our initial assumption was false, and there must exist an element $g \in G$ that fixes no element of $X$.

A map $\phi: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is said to be an affine-linear bijection if it is of the form

$\phi(x)=a x+b \quad(a, b \in \mathbb{R}: a \neq 0)$

1. Show that the set of affine-linear bijections forms a group $G$ under composition.

   Proof: Let $\phi_1(x) = a_1 x + b_1$ and $\phi_2(x) = a_2 x + b_2$ be two affine-linear bijections. Their composition is given by

   $\phi_1 \circ \phi_2 (x) = \phi_1(a_2 x + b_2) = a_1 (a_2 x + b_2) + b_1 = (a_1 a_2)x + (a_1 b_2 + b_1)$

   This is again an affine-linear bijection with parameters $a = a_1 a_2$ and $b = a_1 b_2 + b_1$. The identity element is $\phi(x) = 1 \cdot x + 0$, and the inverse of $\phi(x) = a x + b$ is given by $\phi^{-1}(x) = \frac{1}{a} x - \frac{b}{a}$, which is also an affine-linear bijection. Thus, the set of affine-linear bijections forms a group under composition.
   
2. Show that $G$ is isomorphic to semidirect product of abelian groups $A$ and $B$. Make sure to identify the groups $A$ and $B$, as well as the action of one on the other used in the semidirect product.
   
   Solution: Let $B$ be the group of translations $`\{ \phi_b(x) = x + b \mid b \in \mathbb{R} \}`$, which is isomorphic to $(\mathbb{R}, +)$, and let $A$ be the group of dilations $`\{ \phi_a(x) = a x \mid a \in \mathbb{R}^* \}`$, which is isomorphic to $(\mathbb{R}^*, \cdot)$.

   The group $G$ can be expressed as the semidirect product $G \cong B \rtimes A$, where the action of $A$ on $B$ is given by conjugation:

   $\phi_a \circ \phi_b \circ \phi_a^{-1}(x) = a\left(\frac{x}{a} + b\right) = x + ab$
   
   Thus, the action of $A$ on $B$ is given by scaling the translation parameter by the dilation factor.
