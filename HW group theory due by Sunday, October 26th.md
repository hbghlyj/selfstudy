1. True or false: In a free abelian group of finite rank, every linearly independent set can be completed to a basis?

   False.

   The set {2} in $\mathbb{Z}$ is linearly independent, but it does not generate $\mathbb{Z}$ (e.g., 1 is not a multiple of 2). Any extension, like $\{2, n\}$ for an integer $n \neq 0$, is linearly dependent because of the non-trivial linear combination $n \cdot 2 - 2 \cdot n = 0$. Therefore, $\{2\}$ cannot be extended to a basis.

2. How many different (up to isomorphism) abelian groups of order 300 are there?

   Four.

   $300=2^2 \times 3 \times 5^2$
   
   The number of groups is $p(2) \times p(1) \times p(2) = 2 \times 1 \times 2 = 4$, where $p(n)$ is the number of partitions of $n$.
3. True or false: For any action of a finite group $G$ on a finite set $X$, the cardinality $|X|$ divides $|G|$?

   False. The trivial group acts on any set but $|G|=1$.
   
4. Give an example of an infinite group $G$ such that every element of $G$ has finite order.

   The group $\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$ is infinite, and every element $[\frac{n}{m}]$ has finite order since $m \cdot [\frac{n}{m}] = [n] = [0]$.
5. Let $F_2$ be the free group on two generators. True or false: For every $n$, there exists a normal subgroup $H_n \subset F_2$ such that $F_2 / H_n \simeq S_n$?

    True. Since $S_n$ is generated by the cycles $(12)$ and $(123\dots n)$ for $n \ge 2$ (and the case $n=1$ is trivial), let $H_n$ be the kernel of $F\langle a,b\rangle\to S_n,a\mapsto(12),b\mapsto(123\dots n)$.

   $H_n$ is a normal subgroup of $F_2$ such that $F_2 / H_n \simeq S_n$.

Let $\mathbb{Q}^{\times}$ be the group of non-zero rational numbers under multiplication.
1. Show that $\mathbb{Q}^{\times}$ is isomorphic to the product of $\mathbb{Z} / 2 \mathbb{Z}$ and a free abelian group.

  Proof
  
   We can write any non-zero rational number as $q = \frac{a}{b}$ where $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $\gcd(a, b) = 1$. The group $\mathbb{Q}^{\times}$ can be decomposed as follows:
   
   $`\mathbb{Q}^{\times} \simeq \mathbb{Z} / 2 \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}^{\oplus \infty}`$
   
   Here, $\mathbb{Z} / 2 \mathbb{Z}$ corresponds to the sign of the rational number (positive or negative), and $\mathbb{Z}^{\oplus \infty}$ corresponds to the infinite direct sum of the prime factors in the numerator and denominator.

2. Describe all group homomorphisms $\mathbb{Z} / 2 \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Q}^{\times}$.
3. Describe all group homomorphisms $\mathbb{Q}^{\times} \to \mathbb{Z} / 2 \mathbb{Z}$.

Let $G$ be a group of order $2017 \times 2027 \times 2029$ (these are all prime numbers). Show that $G$ is cyclic.
# 4
Let $G$ be a finite group, and let $A=\mathrm{Aut}(G)$ be the group of automorphisms $\phi: G \to G$. Consider the natural action of $A$ on $G$, and take the quotient $G / A$.
1. What is $|G / A|$ if $G=\mathbb{Z} / 6 \mathbb{Z}$.

2. Show that if $|G / A|=2$, then $G \simeq(\mathbb{Z} / p \mathbb{Z})^n$ for a prime $p$ and $n>0$.

# 5
A finite group $G$ acts transitively (that is, with a single orbit) on a finite set $X$ such that $|X|>1$. Show that there exists an element $g \in G$ which does not fix any element of $X$.

# 6
A map $\phi: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is said to be an affine-linear bijection if it is of the form

$\phi(x)=a x+b \quad(a, b \in \mathbb{R}: a \neq 0)$

1. Show that the set of affine-linear bijections forms a group $G$ under composition.
   
2. Show that $G$ is isomorphic to semidirect product of abelian groups $A$ and $B$. Make sure to identify the groups $A$ and $B$, as well as the action of one on the other used in the semidirect product.
