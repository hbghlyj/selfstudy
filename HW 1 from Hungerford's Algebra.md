# Section I.2
## Exercise 2
A group $G$ is abelian if and only if the map $G \to G$ given by $x \mapsto x^{-1}$ is an automorphism.

Proof

## Exercise 3
Let $Q_8$ be the group (under ordinary matrix multiplication) generated by the complex matrices $`A=\begin{psmallmatrix}0 & 1 \\ -1 & 0\end{psmallmatrix}`$ and $`B=\begin{psmallmatrix}0 & i \\ i & 0\end{psmallmatrix}`$, where $i^2=-1$.

Show that $Q_8$ is a nonabelian group of order $8$, called the quaternion group.

Hint: Observe that $B A=A^3 B$, whence every element of $Q_8$ is of the form $A^i B^j$. Note also that $A^4=B^4=I$, where $`I=\begin{psmallmatrix}1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1\end{psmallmatrix}`$ is the identity element of $Q_8$.

Proof


# Section I.4
## Exercise 8
If $H$ and $K$ are subgroups of finite index of a group $G$ such that $[G: H]$ and $[G: K]$ are relatively prime, then $G=H K$.

Proof

## Exercise 12
If $H$ and $K$ are subgroups of a group $G$, then $[H \vee K: H] \geq[K: H \cap K]$.

Proof

## Exercise 13
If $p>q$ are primes, a group of order $p q$ has at most one subgroup of order $p$.

Hint: Suppose $H, K$ are distinct subgroups of order $p$. Show $H \cap K=\langle e\rangle$; use Exercise 12 to get a contradiction.

Proof

# Section I.5
## Exercise 1
If $N$ is a subgroup of index 2 in a group $G$, then $N$ is normal in $G$.

Proof

## Exercise 6
Let $H<G$; then the set $a H a^{-1}$ is a subgroup for each $a \in G$, and $H \cong a H a^{-1}$.

Proof

## Exercise 7
Let $G$ be a finite group and $H$ a subgroup of $G$ of order $n$. If $H$ is the only subgroup of $G$ of order $n$, then $H$ is normal in $G$.

Proof

# Section I.6
## Exercise 3
If $\sigma=(i_1 i_2 \cdots i_r) \in S_n$ and $\tau \in S_n$, then $\tau \sigma \tau^{-1}$ is the $r$-cycle $(\tau(i_1) \tau(i_2) \cdots \tau(i_r))$.

Proof

## Exercise 8
The group $A_4$ has no subgroup of order 6.

Proof

## Exercise 12
The center of the group $D_n$ is $\langle e\rangle$ if $n$ is odd and isomorphic to $Z_2$ if $n$ is even.

Proof
