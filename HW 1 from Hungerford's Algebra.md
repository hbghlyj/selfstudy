## Exercise 2
A group $G$ is abelian if and only if the map $G \to G$ given by $x \mapsto x^{-1}$ is an automorphism.

Proof

Forward direction, assume $G$ is abelian, then $(x y)^{-1} = y^{-1} x^{-1} = x^{-1} y^{-1}$ for any $x, y \in G$, so the map is a homomorphism. It is bijective since each element has a unique inverse, so it is an automorphism.

Conversely, assume the map is an automorphism, $(x y)^{-1} = x^{-1} y^{-1}$ for any $x, y \in G$, so $y^{-1} x^{-1} = x^{-1} y^{-1}$. Taking inverses of both sides gives $x y = y x$, so $G$ is abelian.

## Exercise 3
Let $Q_8$ be the group (under ordinary matrix multiplication) generated by the complex matrices $`A=\begin{psmallmatrix}0 & 1 \\ -1 & 0\end{psmallmatrix}`$ and $`B=\begin{psmallmatrix}0 & i \\ i & 0\end{psmallmatrix}`$, where $i^2=-1$.

Show that $Q_8$ is a nonabelian group of order $8$, called the quaternion group.

Proof

Let $H=\langle A\rangle,K=\langle B\rangle$.

We compute $`H=\{I,A,-I,-A\},K=\{I,B,-I,-B\}`$, so $`H\cap K=\{\pm I\}`$.

We compute $BAB^{-1}=A^3$, so $H \lhd Q_8$.

By the theorem <q>subgroup product $HK$ form a group if $H$ is normal</q> we have $Q_8=HK$, so $|Q_8|=\frac{|H||K|}{|H\cap K|}=\frac{4\times4}2=8$.

The group is nonabelian since $`A B = \begin{psmallmatrix}i & 0 \\ 0 & -i\end{psmallmatrix}`$ and $`B A = \begin{psmallmatrix}-i & 0 \\ 0 & i\end{psmallmatrix}`$ are not equal.

## Exercise 8
If $H$ and $K$ are subgroups of finite index of a group $G$ such that $[G: H]$ and $[G: K]$ are relatively prime, then $G=H K$.

Proof

Consider the map $f:K/H\cap K\to G/H$ defined by $f(k H\cap K)=k H$. This map is injective since if $f(k_1 H\cap K)=f(k_2 H\cap K)$, then $k_1 H=k_2 H$, so $k_2^{-1} k_1 \in H$, and since $k_2^{-1} k_1 \in K$, $k_2^{-1} k_1 \in H\cap K$, so $k_1 H\cap K=k_2 H\cap K$. Thus $[K:H\cap K] \leq [G:H]$.

Since $[K:H\cap K]$ is finite we can write

$[G:H][H:H\cap K]=[G:H\cap K]=[G:K][K:H\cap K]$

then $[G:H]\mid[G:K][K:H\cap K]$, but $[G:H]$ and $[G:K]$ are relatively prime, then $[G:H]\mid[K:H\cap K]$, but we proved $[K:H\cap K] \leq [G:H]$, we must have $[K:H\cap K] = [G:H]$. Therefore, $f$ is surjective, so for any $g \in G$, there exists $k \in K$ such that $g H = k H$, so $k^{-1} g \in H$, and thus $g = k (k^{-1} g) \in KH$. Therefore, $G = KH$. By taking inverse, we get $G=HK$.

## Exercise 12
If $H$ and $K$ are subgroups of a group $G$, then $[H \vee K: H] \geq[K: H \cap K]$.

Proof

## Exercise 13
If $p>q$ are primes, a group of order $p q$ has at most one subgroup of order $p$.

Hint: Suppose $H, K$ are distinct subgroups of order $p$. Show $H \cap K=\langle e\rangle$; use Exercise 12 to get a contradiction.

Proof

# Section I.5
## Exercise 1
If $N$ is a subgroup of index 2 in a group $G$, then $N$ is normal in $G$.

Proof

Let $g \in G \setminus N$; then $G=N \cup g N$. For any $n \in N$, $g n \notin N$. Thus $g N = G \setminus N$. Similarly, $N g = G \setminus N$. Thus $g N = N g$ for any $g \in G \setminus N$, and $g N = N g$ for any $g \in N$. Therefore $g N = N g$ for any $g \in G$, so $N$ is normal in $G$.


## Exercise 6
Let $H<G$; then the set $a H a^{-1}$ is a subgroup for each $a \in G$, and $H \cong a H a^{-1}$.

Proof

For any $a \in G$, $a H a^{-1}$ is nonempty since it contains the identity element $a e a^{-1} = e$. If $x, y \in a H a^{-1}$, then $x = a h_1 a^{-1}$ and $y = a h_2 a^{-1}$ for some $h_1, h_2 \in H$. Then $x y^{-1} = a h_1 a^{-1} (a h_2 a^{-1})^{-1} = a h_1 h_2^{-1} a^{-1} \in a H a^{-1}$ since $h_1 h_2^{-1} \in H$. Thus $a H a^{-1}$ is a subgroup of $G$.

Define a map $\phi: H \to a H a^{-1}$ by $\phi(h) = a h a^{-1}$. This map is a homomorphism since $\phi(h_1 h_2) = a (h_1 h_2) a^{-1} = a h_1 a^{-1} a h_2 a^{-1} = \phi(h_1) \phi(h_2)$. It is bijective since its inverse is given by $\phi^{-1}(x) = a^{-1} x a$. Therefore, $H \cong a H a^{-1}$.

## Exercise 7
Let $G$ be a finite group and $H$ a subgroup of $G$ of order $n$. If $H$ is the only subgroup of $G$ of order $n$, then $H$ is normal in $G$.

Proof

For any $g \in G$, by Exercise 6 $g H g^{-1}$ is a subgroup with the same order as $H$, which is $n$. Since $H$ is the only subgroup of $G$ of order $n$, we must have $g H g^{-1} = H$. Therefore, $H$ is normal in $G$.

# Section I.6
## Exercise 3
If $\sigma=(i_1 i_2 \cdots i_r) \in S_n$ and $\tau \in S_n$, then $\tau \sigma \tau^{-1}$ is the $r$-cycle $(\tau(i_1) \tau(i_2) \cdots \tau(i_r))$.

Proof

## Exercise 8
The group $A_4$ has no subgroup of order 6.

Proof

## Exercise 12
The center of the group $D_n$ is $\langle e\rangle$ if $n$ is odd and isomorphic to $Z_2$ if $n$ is even.

Proof
