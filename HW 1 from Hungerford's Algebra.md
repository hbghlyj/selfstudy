## Exercise 2
A group $G$ is abelian if and only if the map $G \to G$ given by $x \mapsto x^{-1}$ is an automorphism.

Proof

Forward direction, assume $G$ is abelian, then $(x y)^{-1} = y^{-1} x^{-1} = x^{-1} y^{-1}$ for any $x, y \in G$, so the map is a homomorphism. It is bijective since each element has a unique inverse, so it is an automorphism.

Conversely, assume the map is an automorphism, $(x y)^{-1} = x^{-1} y^{-1}$ for any $x, y \in G$, so $y^{-1} x^{-1} = x^{-1} y^{-1}$. Taking inverses of both sides gives $x y = y x$, so $G$ is abelian.

## Exercise 3
Let $Q_8$ be the group (under ordinary matrix multiplication) generated by the complex matrices $`A=\begin{psmallmatrix}0 & 1 \\ -1 & 0\end{psmallmatrix}`$ and $`B=\begin{psmallmatrix}0 & i \\ i & 0\end{psmallmatrix}`$, where $i^2=-1$.

Show that $Q_8$ is a nonabelian group of order $8$, called the quaternion group.

Proof

Let $H=\langle A\rangle,K=\langle B\rangle$.

We compute $`H=\{I,A,-I,-A\},K=\{I,B,-I,-B\}`$, so $`H\cap K=\{\pm I\}`$.

We compute $BAB^{-1}=A^3$, so $H \lhd Q_8$.

By the theorem <q>If $H⊴G$ and $K≤G$, then $HK≤G$</q> we have $Q_8=HK$, so $|Q_8|=\frac{|H||K|}{|H\cap K|}=\frac{4\times4}2=8$.

The group is nonabelian since $`A B = \begin{psmallmatrix}i & 0 \\ 0 & -i\end{psmallmatrix}`$ and $`B A = \begin{psmallmatrix}-i & 0 \\ 0 & i\end{psmallmatrix}`$ are not equal.

# Section I.4
## Exercise 8
If $H$ and $K$ are subgroups of finite index of a group $G$ such that $[G: H]$ and $[G: K]$ are relatively prime, then $G=H K$.

Proof

Let $L=H\cap K$. Consider the map $f:K/L\to G/H,Lk\mapsto Hk$ for $k \in K$.

$f$ is well-defined: if $Lk_1=Lk_2$, then $k_2k_1^{-1}\in L\subseteq H$, so $Hk_1=Hk_2$.

$f$ is injective: if $f(Lk_1)=f(Lk_2)$, then $Hk_1=Hk_2$, so $k_2k_1^{-1}\in H$. From $k_2k_1^{-1}\in H$ and $k_1,k_2\in K$, it follows that $k_2k_1^{-1} \in H \cap K = L$. This then implies $Lk_1=Lk_2$.

Since $[K:L]$ is finite we can write

$[G:H][H:L]=[G:L]=[G:K][K:L]$

then $[G:H]\mid[G:K][K:L]$, but $[G:H]$ and $[G:K]$ are relatively prime, then $[G:H]\mid[K:L]$, in particular $[G:H] \le [K:L]$.

Since an injective map between finite sets with ∣domain∣≥∣codomain∣ is surjective, $f$ is surjective. For any $g \in G$, there exists $k \in K$ such that $Hg = Hk$, so $gk^{-1} \in H$, and thus $g = (gk^{-1})k \in HK$. Therefore, $G = HK$.

## Exercise 12
If $H$ and $K$ are subgroups of a group $G$, then $[H \vee K: H] \geq[K: H \cap K]$.

Proof

Since $H\vee K\supseteq HK$, it suffices to show that $[HK: H] \geq[K: H \cap K]$.

Consider the map $f: K/(H \cap K) \to HK/H,(H \cap K) k\mapsto H k$ for $k \in K$.

$f$ is well-defined: if $(H \cap K) k_1 = (H \cap K) k_2$, then $k_2 k_1^{-1} \in H \cap K \subseteq H$, so $H k_1 = H k_2$.

$f$ is injective: if $f((H \cap K) k_1) = f((H \cap K) k_2)$, then $H k_1 = H k_2$, so $k_2 k_1^{-1} \in H$. Since $k_1, k_2 \in K$, we have $k_2 k_1^{-1} \in H \cap K$, thus $(H \cap K) k_1 = (H \cap K) k_2$.

Hence there is an injection of coset sets, so the index inequality follows.

## Exercise 13
If $p>q$ are primes, a group of order $p q$ has at most one subgroup of order $p$.

Proof 1

Suppose $H, K$ are distinct subgroups of order $p$. Since $p$ is prime, $H \cap K$ is either $\langle e \rangle$ or $H$ (or $K$). Since $H$ and $K$ are distinct, we must have $H \cap K = \langle e \rangle$.

By Exercise 12, $[H \vee K : H] \geq [K : H \cap K] = [K : \langle e \rangle] = |K| = p$. Thus, $|H \vee K| = [H \vee K : H] |H| \geq p \cdot p = p^2 > p q$, which is a contradiction since $H \vee K$ is a subgroup of $G$. Therefore, there can be at most one subgroup of order $p$ in a group of order $p q$.

Proof 2

By Sylow's theorems, the number of Sylow $p$-subgroups, denoted $n_p$, satisfies $n_p \equiv 1 \mod p$ and $n_p \mid q$. Since $q < p$, the only divisor of $q$ that is congruent to $1 \mod p$ is $1$. Therefore, $n_p=1$.

# Section I.5
## Exercise 1
If $N$ is a subgroup of index 2 in a group $G$, then $N$ is normal in $G$.

Proof

Let $g \in G \setminus N$, then $N\ne gN$, so $G=N \sqcup g N$. Thus $g N = G \setminus N$. Similarly, $N g = G \setminus N$. Thus $g N = N g$ for any $g \in G \setminus N$, and $g N = N g$ for any $g \in N$. Therefore $g N = N g$ for any $g \in G$, so $N$ is normal in $G$.


## Exercise 6
Let $H<G$; then the set $a H a^{-1}$ is a subgroup for each $a \in G$, and $H \cong a H a^{-1}$.

Proof

For any $a \in G$, $a H a^{-1}$ is nonempty since it contains the identity element $a e a^{-1} = e$. If $x, y \in a H a^{-1}$, then $x = a h_1 a^{-1}$ and $y = a h_2 a^{-1}$ for some $h_1, h_2 \in H$. Then $x y^{-1} = a h_1 a^{-1} (a h_2 a^{-1})^{-1} = a h_1 h_2^{-1} a^{-1} \in a H a^{-1}$ since $h_1 h_2^{-1} \in H$. Thus $a H a^{-1}$ is a subgroup of $G$.

Define a map $\phi: H \to a H a^{-1}$ by $\phi(h) = a h a^{-1}$. This map is a homomorphism since $\phi(h_1 h_2) = a (h_1 h_2) a^{-1} = a h_1 a^{-1} a h_2 a^{-1} = \phi(h_1) \phi(h_2)$. It is bijective since its inverse is given by $\phi^{-1}(x) = a^{-1} x a$. Therefore, $H \cong a H a^{-1}$.

## Exercise 7
Let $G$ be a finite group and $H$ a subgroup of $G$ of order $n$. If $H$ is the only subgroup of $G$ of order $n$, then $H$ is normal in $G$.

Proof

For any $g \in G$, by Exercise 6, $g H g^{-1}$ is a subgroup with the same order as $H$, which is $n$. Since $H$ is the only subgroup of $G$ of order $n$, we must have $g H g^{-1} = H$. Therefore, $H$ is normal in $G$.

# Section I.6
## Exercise 3
If $\sigma=(i_1 i_2 \cdots i_r) \in S_n$ and $\tau \in S_n$, then $\tau \sigma \tau^{-1}$ is the $r$-cycle $(\tau(i_1) \tau(i_2) \cdots \tau(i_r))$.

Proof

For any $`j \in \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}`$

* If $j$ is not in the image of $\tau$ applied to the elements of the cycle, then $\tau^{-1}(j)$ is not in $`\{i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_r\}`$, and $\sigma$ fixes it. Thus,

  $\tau \sigma \tau^{-1}(j) = j$
* If $j = \tau(i_k)$ for some $k$, then $\tau^{-1}(j) = i_k$, and $\sigma(i_k) = i_{k+1}$ (with $i_{r+1} = i_1$). Thus,

  $\tau \sigma \tau^{-1}(j) = \tau(i_{k+1})$

Therefore, $\tau \sigma \tau^{-1}$ permutes the elements $\tau(i_1), \tau(i_2), \ldots, \tau(i_r)$ in the same way that $\sigma$ permutes $i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_r$, and fixes all other elements. Hence, $\tau \sigma \tau^{-1}$ is the $r$-cycle $(\tau(i_1) \tau(i_2) \cdots \tau(i_r))$.

## Exercise 8
The group $A_4$ has no subgroup of order 6.

Proof

Assume $H < A_4$ with $|H| = 6$.

Since $[A_4 : H] = 2$, by Exercise 5.1, $H \lhd A_4$.

Since $|H|$ is even, by Exercise 1.14, $H$ contains an element of order 2, but elements of $A_4$ of order 2 are the double transpositions, so $H$ contains a double transposition e.g., (12)(34), but then $(132) (12)(34) (132)^{-1} = (13)(24)$, by normality, $(13)(24) \in H$, similarly $(23)(14) \in H$, but then $V_4 \subseteq H$, so $4 \mid 6$, a contradiction.

## Exercise 12
The center of the group $D_n$ is $\langle e\rangle$ if $n$ is odd and isomorphic to $Z_2$ if $n$ is even.

Proof

$D_n= \langle r, s \mid r^n = s^2 = e, s r s = r^{-1}\rangle$, where $r$ is a rotation and $s$ is a reflection. The center of $D_n$ consists of elements that commute with both $r$ and $s$. Elements of $D_n$ are of the form $r^k$ or $s r^k$ for $0 \leq k < n$.

A reflection cannot be in the center because $r (s r^k) = s r^{k-1}$ while $(s r^k) r = s r^{k+1}$, which are not equal for $n \ge 3$. Thus, only rotations can be in the center.

All rotations commute with each other, so any $r^k$ commutes with $r$. However, to commute with $s$, we need $r^k s = s r^k$, which implies $s r^k s = r^{-k} = r^k$. This holds if and only if $r^{2k} = e$, meaning $2k \equiv 0 \mod n$. Thus, if $n$ is odd, the center is $`\{e\}`$, and if $n$ is even, the center is $`\{e, r^{n/2}\} \cong Z_2`$.
