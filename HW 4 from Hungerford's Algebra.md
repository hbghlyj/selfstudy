Suppose $G=\mathbb{Z} \times(\mathbb{Z} / 10 \mathbb{Z}) \times(\mathbb{Z} / 100 \mathbb{Z})$, and $H$ is the subgroup generated by elements $(1,1,1),(1,2,3)$.
1. What is the isomorphism class of $H$? (That is, what is $H$ 's standard form, as in Theorem 2.6(ii) or Theorem 2.6(iii)?
2. What is the isomorphism class of $G / H$?
