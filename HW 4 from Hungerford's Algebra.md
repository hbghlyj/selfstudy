## Problem 1
Show that a finite abelian group that is not cyclic contains a subgroup which is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_p \oplus\mathbb{Z}_p$ for some prime $p$.

Proof

By the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, any finite abelian group $G$ can be expressed as a direct sum of cyclic groups of prime power order:

$`G \cong \mathbb{Z}_{p_1^{k_1}} \oplus \dots \oplus \mathbb{Z}_{p_r^{k_r}}`$.

A finite abelian group is cyclic if and only if the primes $p_1, \dots, p_r$ in this decomposition are distinct.

Since $G$ is not cyclic, at least two of these primes must be the same, say $p_i = p_j = p$ for some $i \neq j$.

This implies that $G$ has a subgroup isomorphic to

$`\mathbb{Z}_{p^{k_i}} \oplus \mathbb{Z}_{p^{k_j}}`$

where $k_i, k_j \ge 1$.

The group $`\mathbb{Z}_{p^{k_i}}`$ has a unique subgroup of order $p$ (isomorphic to $`\mathbb{Z}_p`$), and so does $`\mathbb{Z}_{p^{k_j}}`$.

Therefore, their direct sum contains a subgroup isomorphic to $`\mathbb{Z}_p \oplus \mathbb{Z}_p`$.

Thus, $G$ contains a subgroup isomorphic to $`\mathbb{Z}_p \oplus \mathbb{Z}_p`$.

## Problem 7 ($G(p)$ is defined in Lemma II.2.5)
A (sub)group in which every element has order a power of a fixed prime $p$ is called a $p$-(sub)group (note: $|0|=1=p^0$). Let $G$ be an abelian torsion group.
<ol>
<li>

$G(p)$ is the unique maximum $p$-subgroup of $G$ (that is, every $p$-subgroup of $G$ is contained in $G(p)$).
</li>
<li>

$G=\sum G(p)$, where the sum is over all primes $p$ such that $G(p) \neq 0$.
  
Hint: If $|u|=p_1^{n_1} \cdots p_t^{n_t}$, let $m_i=|u| / p_i^{n_i}$. There exist $c_i \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $c_1 m_1+\cdots +c_t m_t=1$, whence $u=c_1 m_1 u+\cdots+c_t m_t u$; but $c_i m_i u \in G(p_i)$.
</li>
<li>

If $H$ is another abelian torsion group, then $G \cong H$ if and only if $G(p) \cong H(p)$ for all primes $p$.
</li>
</ol>

Proof

<ol>
<li>

$`G(p)=\{u \in G \mid |u|=p^n \text { for some } n \geq 0\}`$ is a subgroup of $G$.

To show this:

- the identity $0 \in G(p)$ since $|0|=1=p^0$.

- If $u, v \in G(p)$ with $|u|=p^a$ and $|v|=p^b$, then since $G$ is abelian, $|u+v|$ divides $\mathrm{lcm}(|u|,|v|) = p^{\max(a,b)}$, so $u+v \in G(p)$.

- Also, $|-u|=|u|$, so inverses are in $G(p)$.

If $H$ is any $p$-subgroup of $G$, then every element of $H$ has order a power of $p$, so $H \subseteq G(p)$.

Thus, $G(p)$ is the unique maximum $p$-subgroup of $G$.
</li>
<li>

Let $u \in G$ be an arbitrary element.

Since $G$ is a torsion group, $|u|$ is finite and can be expressed as

$`|u|=p_1^{n_1} p_2^{n_2} \cdots p_t^{n_t}`$ for distinct primes $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_t$ and integers $n_i \geq 0$.

Define $m_i = |u| / p_i^{n_i}$.

By Bezout's identity, there exist integers $c_i$ such that

$`c_1 m_1 + c_2 m_2 + \cdots + c_t m_t = 1`$

Then we can express $u$ as:

$`u = c_1 m_1 u + c_2 m_2 u + \cdots + c_t m_t u.`$

Each term $c_i m_i u$ has an order that divides $`p_i^{n_i}`$, so $`c_i m_i u \in G(p_i)`$.

Therefore, $u$ can be expressed as a sum of elements from different $G(p_i)$, which shows $G = \sum_p G(p)$.

This sum is direct, as an element in $G(p) \cap \sum_{q \neq p} G(q)$ must have an order that is a power of $p$ and also coprime to $p$, which implies the order is 1, so the element is 0.
</li>
<li>

If $G \cong H$, then there exists an isomorphism $\phi: G \to H$.

This isomorphism preserves the order of elements, so $x \in G(p)$ if and only if $\phi(x) \in H(p)$.

Thus, $\phi$ restricts to an isomorphism between $G(p)$ and $H(p)$ for each prime $p$.

Conversely, if $G(p) \cong H(p)$ for all primes $p$, let $\phi_p: G(p) \to H(p)$ be an isomorphism for each $p$.

By part (ii), $G = \bigoplus_p G(p)$ and $H = \bigoplus_p H(p)$.

We can define an isomorphism $\phi: G \to H$ by $\phi(\sum_p g_p) = \sum_p \phi_p(g_p)$ for $g_p \in G(p)$.

Thus $G \cong H$.
</li>
</ol>

## Problem 9
How many subgroups of order $p^2$ does the abelian group $`\mathbb{Z}_{p^3} \oplus \mathbb{Z}_{p^2}`$ have?

Proof

By the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, any subgroup of order $p^2$ must be isomorphic to either $`\mathbb{Z}_{p^2}`$ or $`\mathbb{Z}_p \oplus \mathbb{Z}_p`$.

1. **Subgroups isomorphic to $`\mathbb{Z}_{p^2}`$**:

   A subgroup isomorphic to $`\mathbb{Z}_{p^2}`$ is cyclic and must be generated by an element of order $p^2$. We can count these by finding the number of elements of order $p^2$ and dividing by the number of generators for each subgroup, $\phi(p^2) = p^2-p$.

   An element $(a,b) \in G$ has order $p^2$ if and only if its order divides $p^2$ but does not divide $p$.
   - The number of elements with order dividing $p^2$ is $`|G[p^2]| = |\mathbb{Z}_{p^3}[p^2]| \cdot |\mathbb{Z}_{p^2}[p^2]| = p^2 \cdot p^2 = p^4`$.
   - The number of elements with order dividing $p$ is $`|G[p]| = |\mathbb{Z}_{p^3}[p]| \cdot |\mathbb{Z}_{p^2}[p]| = p \cdot p = p^2`$.
   
   Therefore, the total number of elements of order $p^2$ is $p^4 - p^2$.

    Each subgroup is generated by $p^2 - p$ elements (the generators of the cyclic group of order $p^2$). Thus, the number of distinct subgroups is:
    
    $`\frac{p^4 - p^2}{p^2 - p} = \frac{p^2(p^2-1)}{p(p-1)} = p(p+1)`$.

2. **Subgroups isomorphic to $`\mathbb{Z}_p \oplus \mathbb{Z}_p`$**:

   The subgroup of elements with order dividing $p$ is $`G[p] = \{ (a,b) \in G \mid pa=0, pb=0 \}`$. In $`G=\mathbb{Z}_{p^3} \oplus \mathbb{Z}_{p^2}`$, this is the subgroup $`\langle p^2 \rangle \oplus \langle p \rangle \cong \mathbb{Z}_p \oplus \mathbb{Z}_p`$. Any subgroup isomorphic to $`\mathbb{Z}_p \oplus \mathbb{Z}_p`$ must be contained in $G[p]$. Since both have order $p^2$, they must be identical. Therefore, there is only one such subgroup.

# Section II.4
## Problem 1
Let $G$ be a group and $A$ a normal abelian subgroup. Show that $G / A$ operates on $A$ by conjugation and obtain a homomorphism $G / A \to \mathrm{Aut} A$.

Proof

Since $A$ is a normal subgroup of $G$, for any $g \in G$ and $a \in A$, the element $gag^{-1}$ is also in $A$. This allows us to define an action of the quotient group $G/A$ on the subgroup $A$ by conjugation.

Define a map $\varphi: G/A \to \mathrm{Aut} A$ by $\varphi(gA)(a) = gag^{-1}$ for all $g \in G$ and $a \in A$.
First, we verify that for any $g \in G$, the map $\varphi_g: a \mapsto gag^{-1}$ is an automorphism of $A$. 
- **Homomorphism**: For any $a, b \in A$, $\varphi_g(ab) = g(ab)g^{-1} = (gag^{-1})(gbg^{-1}) = \varphi_g(a)\varphi_g(b)$.
- **Bijective**: The map $\varphi_{g^{-1}}$ is its inverse, since $\varphi_g(\varphi_{g^{-1}}(a)) = g(g^{-1}ag)g^{-1} = a$. 

Thus, $\varphi(gA)$ is indeed an element of $\mathrm{Aut} A$.

To show that $\varphi$ is well-defined, we need to check that if $gA = hA$ for some $g, h \in G$, then $\varphi(gA) = \varphi(hA)$. If $gA = hA$, then $h^{-1}g \in A$. Let $k = h^{-1}g$, so $g=hk$. Since $A$ is abelian and $k, a \in A$, we have $kak^{-1} = a$. Thus, for any $a \in A$:

$`\varphi(gA)(a) = gag^{-1} = (hk)a(hk)^{-1} = h(kak^{-1})h^{-1} = hah^{-1} = \varphi(hA)(a).`$

Thus, $\varphi$ is well-defined.

Next, we need to show that $\varphi$ is a homomorphism. For any $gA, hA \in G/A$ and $a \in A$, we have

$`\varphi(gA \cdot hA)(a) = \varphi(ghA)(a) = (gh)a(gh)^{-1} = g(hah^{-1})g^{-1} = \varphi(gA)(\varphi(hA)(a)).`$

This shows that $\varphi(gA \cdot hA) = \varphi(gA) \circ \varphi(hA)$, so $\varphi$ is a homomorphism.

Therefore, we have established that $G/A$ operates on $A$ by conjugation and that there is a homomorphism $\varphi: G/A \to \mathrm{Aut} A$.

## Problem 5
If $H$ is a subgroup of $G$, the factor group $N_G(H) / C_G(H)$ (see Exercise 4) is isomorphic to a subgroup of $\mathrm{Aut} H$.

Proof

Let $\varphi: N_G(H) \to \mathrm{Aut} H$ be defined by $\varphi(g)(h) = ghg^{-1}$ for all $g \in N_G(H)$ and $h \in H$.

Since $g \in N_G(H)$, we have $ghg^{-1} \in H$, so $\varphi(g)$ is indeed an automorphism of $H$.

The map $\varphi$ is a homomorphism since for any $h \in H$, $(\varphi(g_1g_2))(h) = (g_1g_2)h(g_1g_2)^{-1} = g_1(g_2hg_2^{-1})g_1^{-1} = \varphi(g_1)(\varphi(g_2)(h)) = (\varphi(g_1) \circ \varphi(g_2))(h)$.

The kernel of $\varphi$ is $`\{g \in N_G(H) | ghg^{-1} = h\text{ for all }h \in H\} = N_G(H) \cap C_G(H) = C_G(H)`$, since $C_G(H) \subseteq N_G(H)$.

By the First Isomorphism Theorem, we have

$N_G(H) / C_G(H) \cong \mathrm{Im}(\varphi),$

where $\mathrm{Im}(\varphi)$ is a subgroup of $\mathrm{Aut} H$.

Thus, $N_G(H) / C_G(H)$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $\mathrm{Aut} H$.

## Problem 7
Let $G$ be a group and let $\mathrm{In} G$ be the set of all inner automorphisms of $G$. Show that $\mathrm{In} G$ is a normal subgroup of $\mathrm{Aut} G$.

Proof

Let $\varphi \in \mathrm{In} G$ and $\psi \in \mathrm{Aut} G$. We need to show that $\psi \varphi \psi^{-1} \in \mathrm{In} G$.

Since $\varphi$ is an inner automorphism, there exists $g \in G$ such that $\varphi(x) = gxg^{-1}$ for all $x \in G$. Then, for any $x \in G$, we have

$\psi \varphi \psi^{-1}(x) = \psi(\varphi(\psi^{-1}(x))) = \psi(g\psi^{-1}(x)g^{-1}) = \psi(g)\psi(\psi^{-1}(x))\psi(g^{-1}) = \psi(g)x(\psi(g))^{-1}.$

Let $h = \psi(g)$. Since $h \in G$, we see that $\psi \varphi \psi^{-1}$ is the inner automorphism given by conjugation by $h$. Thus, $\psi \varphi \psi^{-1} \in \mathrm{In} G$.

Therefore, $\mathrm{In} G$ is a normal subgroup of $\mathrm{Aut} G$.

## Problem 9
If $G / C(G)$ is cyclic, then $G$ is abelian.

---

Suppose $G=\mathbb{Z} \times(\mathbb{Z} / 10 \mathbb{Z}) \times(\mathbb{Z} / 100 \mathbb{Z})$, and $H$ is the subgroup generated by elements $(1,1,1),(1,2,3)$.
1. What is the isomorphism class of $H$? (That is, what is $H$'s standard form, as in Theorem 2.6(ii) or Theorem 2.6(iii)?)
2. What is the isomorphism class of $G / H$?

Proof

1. Subtracting $(1,1,1)$ from $(1,2,3)$ gives $(0,1,2)$. Thus, $H$ is generated by $(1,1,1)$ and $(0,1,2)$. The element $(1,1,1)$ has infinite order since its first component is in $\mathbb{Z}$. The element $(0,1,2)$ has order $\mathrm{lcm}(10, 50) = 50$. Therefore, $H \cong \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}_{50}$.
2. To find the isomorphism class of $G/H$, we analyze the relations in the quotient group.

   Let $e_1=(1,0,0), e_2=(0,1,0), e_3=(0,0,1)$ be the standard generators.

   In $G/H$, we have the relations from $H$: $(1,1,1)=e_1+e_2+e_3=0$ and $(1,2,3)=e_1+2e_2+3e_3=0$.

   Subtracting these gives $e_2+2e_3=0$, so $e_2=-2e_3$.

   Substituting back gives $e_1-2e_3+e_3=0$, so $e_1=e_3$.

   The relations from $G$ are $10e_2=0$ and $100e_3=0$.

   In terms of $e_3$, the first relation becomes $10(-2e_3)=-20e_3=0$.

   So $G/H$ is generated by the coset of $e_3$ with relations $20e_3=0$ and $100e_3=0$.

   This implies the order of the generator is $\gcd(20,100)=20$.

   Therefore, $G/H \cong \mathbb{Z}_{20}$.
