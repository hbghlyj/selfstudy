# Section II.2
## Problem 1
Show that a finite abelian group that is not cyclic contains a subgroup which is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_p \oplus\mathbb{Z}_p$ for some prime $p$.

Proof

By the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, any finite abelian group $G$ can be expressed as a direct sum of cyclic groups of prime power order:

$`G \cong \mathbb{Z}_{p_1^{k_1}} \oplus \dots \oplus \mathbb{Z}_{p_r^{k_r}}`$.

A finite abelian group is cyclic if and only if the primes $p_1, \dots, p_r$ in this decomposition are distinct.

Since $G$ is not cyclic, at least two of these primes must be the same, say $p_i = p_j = p$ for some $i \neq j$.

This implies that $G$ has a subgroup isomorphic to

$`\mathbb{Z}_{p^{k_i}} \oplus \mathbb{Z}_{p^{k_j}}`$

where $k_i, k_j \ge 1$.

The group $`\mathbb{Z}_{p^{k_i}}`$ has a unique subgroup of order $p$ (isomorphic to $`\mathbb{Z}_p`$), and so does $`\mathbb{Z}_{p^{k_j}}`$.

Therefore, their direct sum contains a subgroup isomorphic to $`\mathbb{Z}_p \oplus \mathbb{Z}_p`$.

Thus, $G$ contains a subgroup isomorphic to $`\mathbb{Z}_p \oplus \mathbb{Z}_p`$.

## Problem 7 ($G(p)$ is defined in Lemma II.2.5)
A (sub)group in which every element has order a power of a fixed prime $p$ is called a $p$-(sub)group (note: $|0|=1=p^0$). Let $G$ be an abelian torsion group.
<ol>
<li>

$G(p)$ is the unique maximum $p$-subgroup of $G$ (that is, every $p$-subgroup of $G$ is contained in $G(p)$).
</li>
<li>

$G=\sum G(p)$, where the sum is over all primes $p$ such that $G(p) \neq 0$.
  
Hint: If $|u|=p_1^{n_1} \cdots p_t^{n_t}$, let $m_i=|u| / p_i^{n_i}$. There exist $c_i \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $c_1 m_1+\cdots +c_t m_t=1$, whence $u=c_1 m_1 u+\cdots+c_t m_t u$; but $c_i m_i u \in G(p_i)$.
</li>
<li>

If $H$ is another abelian torsion group, then $G \cong H$ if and only if $G(p) \cong H(p)$ for all primes $p$.
</li>
</ol>

Proof

<ol>
<li>

$`G(p)=\{u \in G \mid |u|=p^n \text { for some } n \geq 0\}`$ is a subgroup of $G$.

To show this:

- the identity $0 \in G(p)$ since $|0|=1=p^0$.

- If $u, v \in G(p)$ with $|u|=p^a$ and $|v|=p^b$, then since $G$ is abelian, $|u+v|$ divides $\mathrm{lcm}(|u|,|v|) = p^{\max(a,b)}$, so $u+v \in G(p)$.

- Also, $|-u|=|u|$, so inverses are in $G(p)$.

If $H$ is any $p$-subgroup of $G$, then every element of $H$ has order a power of $p$, so $H \subseteq G(p)$.

Thus, $G(p)$ is the unique maximum $p$-subgroup of $G$.
</li>
<li>

Let $u \in G$ be an arbitrary element.

Since $G$ is a torsion group, $|u|$ is finite and can be expressed as

$`|u|=p_1^{n_1} p_2^{n_2} \cdots p_t^{n_t}`$ for distinct primes $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_t$ and integers $n_i \geq 0$.

Define $m_i = |u| / p_i^{n_i}$.

By Bezout's identity, there exist integers $c_i$ such that

$`c_1 m_1 + c_2 m_2 + \cdots + c_t m_t = 1`$

Then we can express $u$ as:

$`u = c_1 m_1 u + c_2 m_2 u + \cdots + c_t m_t u.`$

Each term $c_i m_i u$ has an order that divides $`p_i^{n_i}`$, so $`c_i m_i u \in G(p_i)`$.

Therefore, $u$ can be expressed as a sum of elements from different $G(p_i)$, which shows $G = \sum_p G(p)$.

This sum is direct, as an element in $G(p) \cap \sum_{q \neq p} G(q)$ must have an order that is a power of $p$ and also coprime to $p$, which implies the order is 1, so the element is 0.
</li>
<li>

If $G \cong H$, then there exists an isomorphism $\phi: G \to H$.

This isomorphism preserves the order of elements, so $x \in G(p)$ if and only if $\phi(x) \in H(p)$.

Thus, $\phi$ restricts to an isomorphism between $G(p)$ and $H(p)$ for each prime $p$.

Conversely, if $G(p) \cong H(p)$ for all primes $p$, let $\phi_p: G(p) \to H(p)$ be an isomorphism for each $p$.

By part (ii), $G = \bigoplus_p G(p)$ and $H = \bigoplus_p H(p)$.

We can define an isomorphism $\phi: G \to H$ by $\phi(\sum_p g_p) = \sum_p \phi_p(g_p)$ for $g_p \in G(p)$.

Thus $G \cong H$.

## Problem 9
How many subgroups of order $p^2$ does the abelian group $`\mathbb{Z}_{p^3} \oplus \mathbb{Z}_{p^2}`$ have?

Proof

By the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, any subgroup of order $p^2$ must be isomorphic to either $`\mathbb{Z}_{p^2}`$ or $`\mathbb{Z}_p \oplus \mathbb{Z}_p`$.

1. **Subgroups isomorphic to $`\mathbb{Z}_{p^2}`$**:

   A subgroup isomorphic to $`\mathbb{Z}_{p^2}`$ must be generated by an element of order $p^2$. The elements of order $p^2$ in $`\mathbb{Z}_{p^3} \oplus \mathbb{Z}_{p^2}`$ are of the form $(a, b)$ where at least one of $a$ or $b$ has order $p^2$.
   - In $`\mathbb{Z}_{p^3}`$, the elements of order $p^2$ are those of the form $kp$ where $`k\in \{1, 2, \ldots, p^2-1\}`$ and $k$ is not divisible by $p$. There are $p^2 - p$ such elements. Thus, the total number of pairs $(a, b)$ where $a$ has order $p^2$ is $(p^2 - p) p^2$.
   - In $`\mathbb{Z}_{p^2}`$, the elements of order $p^2$ are those of the form $k$ where $`k\in \{1, 2, \ldots, p^2-1\}`$ and $k$ is not divisible by $p$. There are $p^2 - p$ such elements. Thus, the total number of pairs $(a, b)$ where $b$ has order $p^2$ is $p^3(p^2 - p)$.

   But we have double-counted the elements of order $p^2$ that come from both components, which are of the form $(k_1 p, k_2)$ where $`k_1 \in \{1, 2, \ldots, p^2-1\}`$ and $`k_2 \in \{1, 2, \ldots, p^2-1\}`$ and both are not divisible by $p$. There are $(p^2 - p)^2$ such elements.
   
   Therefore, the total number of elements of order $p^2$ is:
   
   $`(p^2 - p)p^2 + p^3(p^2 - p) - (p^2 - p)^2 = p^2(p-1)(p^2 + 1)`$.

    Each subgroup is generated by $p^2 - p$ elements (the generators of the cyclic group of order $p^2$). Thus, the number of distinct subgroups is:
    
    $`\frac{p^2(p-1)(p^2 + 1)}{p^2 - p} = p(p^2 + 1)`$.

2. **Subgroups isomorphic to $`\mathbb{Z}_p \oplus \mathbb{Z}_p`$**:

   $G[p] \cong \mathbb{Z}_p \oplus \mathbb{Z}_p$. Since any subgroup of type $`\mathbb{Z}_p \oplus \mathbb{Z}_p`$ must be contained in $G[p]$, and $G[p]$ itself has this structure and order $p^2$, there is only $1$ such subgroup.

# Section II.4
## Problem 1
Let $G$ be a group and $A$ a normal abelian subgroup. Show that $G / A$ operates on $A$ by conjugation and obtain a homomorphism $G / A \to \mathrm{Aut} A$.

## Problem 5
If $H$ is a subgroup of $G$, the factor group $N_G(H) / C_G(H)$ (see Exercise 4) is isomorphic to a subgroup of $\mathrm{Aut} H$.

Proof

Let $\varphi: N_G(H) \to \mathrm{Aut} H$ be defined by $\varphi(g)(h) = ghg^{-1}$ for all $g \in N_G(H)$ and $h \in H$. Since $g \in N_G(H)$, we have $ghg^{-1} \in H$, so $\varphi(g)$ is indeed an automorphism of $H$.

The map $\varphi$ is a homomorphism since $\varphi(g_1g_2) =g_1g_2hg_2^{-1}g_1^{-1}= \varphi(g_1)\varphi(g_2)$. The kernel of $\varphi$ is $`\{g \in N_G(H) | ghg^{-1} = h\text{ for all }h \in H\} = N_G(H) \cap C_G(H) = C_G(H)`$, since $C_G(H) \subseteq N_G(H)$. By the First Isomorphism Theorem, we have

$N_G(H) / C_G(H) \cong \mathrm{Im}(\varphi),$

where $\mathrm{Im}(\varphi)$ is a subgroup of $\mathrm{Aut} H$. Thus, $N_G(H) / C_G(H)$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $\mathrm{Aut} H$.

## Problem 7
Let $G$ be a group and let $\mathrm{In} G$ be the set of all inner automorphisms of $G$. Show that $\mathrm{In} G$ is a normal subgroup of $\mathrm{Aut} G$.

## Problem 9
If $G / C(G)$ is cyclic, then $G$ is abelian.

---

Suppose $G=\mathbb{Z} \times(\mathbb{Z} / 10 \mathbb{Z}) \times(\mathbb{Z} / 100 \mathbb{Z})$, and $H$ is the subgroup generated by elements $(1,1,1),(1,2,3)$.
1. What is the isomorphism class of $H$? (That is, what is $H$'s standard form, as in Theorem 2.6(ii) or Theorem 2.6(iii)?)
2. What is the isomorphism class of $G / H$?
