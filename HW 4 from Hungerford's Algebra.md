# Section II.2
## Problem 1
Show that a finite abelian group that is not cyclic contains a subgroup which is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_p \oplus\mathbb{Z}_p$ for some prime $p$.


## Problem 7 ($G(p)$ is defined in Lemma II.2.5)
A (sub)group in which every element has order a power of a fixed prime $p$ is called a $p$-(sub)group (note: $|0|=1=p^0$). Let $G$ be an abelian torsion group.
<ol>
<li>

$G(p)$ is the unique maximum $p$-subgroup of $G$ (that is, every $p$-subgroup of $G$ is contained in $G(p)$).
</li>
<li>

$G=\sum G(p)$, where the sum is over all primes $p$ such that $G(p) \neq 0$.
  
Hint: If $|u|=p_1^{n_1} \cdots p_t^{n_t}$, let $m_i=|u| / p_i^{n_i}$. There exist $c_i \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $c_1 m_1+\cdots +c_t m_t=1$, whence $u=c_1 m_1 u+\cdots+c_t m_t u$; but $c_i m_i u \in G(p_i)$.
</li>
<li>

If $H$ is another abelian torsion group, then $G \cong H$ if and only if $G(p) \cong H(p)$ for all primes $p$.
</li>
</ol>



## Problem 9
How many subgroups of order $p^2$ does the abelian group $`\mathbb{Z}_{p^3} \oplus \mathbb{Z}_{p^2}`$ have?

# Section II.4
## Problem 1
Let $G$ be a group and $A$ a normal abelian subgroup. Show that $G / A$ operates on $A$ by conjugation and obtain a homomorphism $G / A \to \mathrm{Aut} A$.

## Problem 5
If $H$ is a subgroup of $G$, the factor group $N_G(H) / C_G(H)$ (see Exercise 4) is isomorphic to a subgroup of $\mathrm{Aut} H$.

Proof

Let $\varphi: N_G(H) \to \mathrm{Aut} H$ be defined by $\varphi(g)(h) = ghg^{-1}$ for all $g \in N_G(H)$ and $h \in H$. Since $g \in N_G(H)$, we have $ghg^{-1} \in H$, so $\varphi(g)$ is indeed an automorphism of $H$.

The map $\varphi$ is a homomorphism since $\varphi(g_1g_2) = \varphi(g_1)\varphi(g_2)$. The kernel of $\varphi$ is {g \in N_G(H) | ghg^{-1} = h for all h \in H} = N_G(H) \cap C_G(H) = C_G(H), since $C_G(H) \subseteq N_G(H)$. By the First Isomorphism Theorem, we have

$N_G(H) / C_G(H) \cong \mathrm{Im}(\varphi),$

where $\mathrm{Im}(\varphi)$ is a subgroup of $\mathrm{Aut} H$. Thus, $N_G(H) / C_G(H)$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $\mathrm{Aut} H$.

## Problem 7
Let $G$ be a group and let $\mathrm{In} G$ be the set of all inner automorphisms of $G$. Show that $\mathrm{In} G$ is a normal subgroup of $\mathrm{Aut} G$.

## Problem 9
If $G / C(G)$ is cyclic, then $G$ is abelian.

---

Suppose $G=\mathbb{Z} \times(\mathbb{Z} / 10 \mathbb{Z}) \times(\mathbb{Z} / 100 \mathbb{Z})$, and $H$ is the subgroup generated by elements $(1,1,1),(1,2,3)$.
1. What is the isomorphism class of $H$? (That is, what is $H$'s standard form, as in Theorem 2.6(ii) or Theorem 2.6(iii)?)
2. What is the isomorphism class of $G / H$?
